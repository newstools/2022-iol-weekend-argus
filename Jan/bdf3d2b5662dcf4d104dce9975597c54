Delivery workers were released unharmed after their vehicle was ambushed at a stop in Mitchells Plain were they were forced to hand over their goods before they were kidnapped.  Police are investigating cases of kidnapping and robbery following the incident that occurred on Thursday in Portlands.  This comes after reports that the delivery vehicle was ambushed by occupants of a Toyota Quantum during a delivery in Welcome Street.  Police spokesperson Warrant Office Joseph Swartbooi said: “According to reports the vehicle was busy with deliveries, when they were approached by a white Toyota Quantum with unknown suspects, pointing the driver with a firearm.“  “The victims were instructed to load the cargo in the Toyota Quantum. The suspects forced the victims also in the back of the vehicle after which they fled the scene. The victims were later released with no visible injuries. Swartbooi said police are investigating the incident and no arrests have been made as yet.  Mitchells Plain Community Police Forum (CPF) chairperson  Norman Jantjies  said robberies were a frequent and worrying trend in the area.  Jantjies said last month, a driver in Tafelsig was also accosted by unknown assailants who robbed him of his cellphone and an undisclosed amount of money.  “We find it very disturbing that this type of crime is happening because in the end, Mitchells Plain will be deprived of vital goods,” he said.  “We want the community to be more vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour to the SAPS,” said Jantjies. He said the long term plan of the CPF is to recruit more members and make sure that there are more patrollers available in Mitchells Plain.
