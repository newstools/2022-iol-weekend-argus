The Animal Welfare Society of SA said they have noted an increase in the number of dogs testing positive for Parvovirus since the start of the new year. Spokesperson for the AWSSA, Allan Perrins said an assessment on the high cases revealed that owners were not vaccinating their pets. . “We evaluated the reasons for this worrying increase and concluded that it is due to pet owners not vaccinating their pets either at all or on an infrequent basis, “ said Perrins. He said last year they vaccinated a total of 4 443 pets, a drastic decline to the 11 316 dogs and cats that were vaccinated during the 2015/2016 financial year.  Perrins said pet owners tend to ignore the appeals get their furry friends vaccinated. He said over the festive season they registered 80 puppies and dogs with Parvovirus and only a few of them survived. “We only managed to save a few. The vast majority were too sick and succumbed to this awful virus,” he said. Perrins said the only way to reverse the situation was by making sure that all pets were vaccinated on time and that their vaccinations kept up to date. “This neglect is costing pets lives and animal welfare organisations thousands of rands in treatment costs – for a disease that is vaccine preventable,” he said. Perrins said pet owners must be on the lookout for the following symptoms in dogs they suspect might have contracted Parvovirus: Vomiting (watery, foamy or slimy). Diarrhoea (often bloody and foul smelling). Loss of appetite. Listless or depressed. Dull or glassy eyed stare.
