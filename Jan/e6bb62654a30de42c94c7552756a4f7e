Cape Town - Police have confirmed the Chinese businesswoman who was kidnapped last year in Bellville-South, has been reunited with her family.

The brothers, Zia, Alwaan, Zayyad and Zidan Moti, were on their way to school at the Curro Heuwelkruin Independent School  in Polokwane when their vehicle, a BMW, was stopped by two vehicles. The disappearance of businessman Mohammed Noor Karriem still remains a mystery. Karriem, 64, was forced into a vehicle outside of his business, Sweets  For Africa shop in Epping on September 23, 2019. Early last year, a Chinese national was allegedly kidnapped by Mwande Jabavu and Ayanda Morosi, who is believed to have acted as extortionists, demanding R20m from him. The State is set to prove that on June 21 2021, the duo kidnapped Shaqtung Ye near the Panorama building in Strand by forcing him into a vehicle and fled. The two were arrested during an intense investigation. The victim was rescued and treated for assault after being tortured. The duo are currently facing charges of kidnapping and extortion.
