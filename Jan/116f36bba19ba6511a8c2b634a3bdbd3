CAPE TOWN - A Warrant Officer is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Monday for allegedly plotting to hold Correctional Service officers hostage, and murder another officer’s family members. Police spokesperson Thabo Covane said members of the Mangaung Metro’s tactical response team (TRT) carried out an intelligence-driven operation on Friday, that led to the arrest of a 55-year-old Warrant Officer who works at a Medium Prison near Bloemfontein. Intelligence was provided by their crime intelligence unit. The TRT team approached the man at about 6pm, while he was walking in Bloemside Phase 4. The man was carrying a yellow plastic bag, which the TRT team leader asked for permission to search. “Inside the plastic bag, there were two packaged parcels wrapped in black plastic. The first package was opened and 10 wrapped dagga parcels were found," Covane said. “In the second package the police found three 9mm live rounds, loose tobacco, and another pink plastic bag containing a firearm without a magazine, as well as a handwritten conspiracy note. “The note contents indicated a plot to hold Correctional Service officers hostage; escape from prison using a vehicle; illegally cross the border to perform rituals by a traditional healer and returning to plot the murder of another Correctional Services officer’s wife and daughter,” Covane said. An undisclosed amount of money was also found in the man’s pocket. “The 55-year-old suspect was arrested and taken to Bloemspruit Police Station, where a docket of possession of drugs, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, and conspiracy to commit multiple offences, including murder was opened. “The suspect is expected to appear in Bloemfontein Magistrate Court’s on Monday,” Covane said.
