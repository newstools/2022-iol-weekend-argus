CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town is urging residents to assist in the fight against theft and vandalism of electricity infrastructure, saying it was paying millions of rands each year for repairs. In recent months criminals hit multiple substations in the Paarden Eiland area, causing substantial infrastructure damage. This has also impacted the reliability and security of the electricity supply to residents. The City’s mayoral committee member for Energy, councillor Beverley van Reenen condemned the crimes, and said patrols to the area would be increased while additional fencing installed at the affected substations. She said incidents of vandalism have increased dramatically since the start of Covid-19 pandemic. “Vandalism has a direct impact on law-abiding customers who are suffering supply loss as a result. These illegal actions directly impact service delivery to residents, and help is needed from residents across Cape Town to stop the scourge. “We appeal to residents to assist us by reporting any suspicious activities near electricity infrastructure to both the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the City, so that we can bring an end to infrastructure theft and vandalism,” said Van Reenen. The public can anonymously contact 112 from a cell phone or 021 480 7700 for emergencies. Cape Times
