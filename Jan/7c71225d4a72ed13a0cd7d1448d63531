DURBAN - The Proudly South African campaign has called on primary and high school pupils to enter a ‘buy local’ competition by designing a campaign poster that would show consumers why they should buy locally produced goods. One of the lucky winners will bag some amazing locally produced products, among others a school bag, lunch box and selection of stationery. Entries are open to South African school pupils in any age group who are in Grades R through to 12. In support, the campaign has urged South African consumers to buy locally made stationery and school wear in their New Year’s resolution, stating that buying locally could assist in fighting the rapid increase of unemployment which has caused financial strain on businesses and households over the past two years due to Covid-19. “The New Year is the perfect time for children and families to join and celebrate the best of what our country has to offer. Through this competition, we hope to place our youth’s talent on display, as well as remind South Africans of the vital importance of working together to build a better future for all,” said Happy Khumalo-Ngidi, the campaign’s chief marketing officer. Khumalo-Ngidi said with South African’s biggest stores starting to source clothing apparel and merchandise locally, more money would be directed to investing in a better future for the country. To enter, South African pupils with the help of their parents need to state their age and grades on their posters and share this  on social media by January 14, 2022. Proudly South African should be tagged and the hashtags #DesignAnAd, #BackToSchool and #BuyLocalToCreateJobs be used.
