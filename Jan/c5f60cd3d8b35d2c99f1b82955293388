Cape Town - Bound, gagged and shoved in the boot of a car,  two victims of a hijacking are grateful to be alive after they were found by two City Leap officers. The officers were on patrol in  Kuyasa, Khayelitsha on Tuesday morning around 1am when they noticed a suspicious car in the area, a known hotspot for hijackings. City of Cape Town’s Law Enforcement spokesman Wayne Dyason said  the officers were patrolling  Ntlazane road when they saw a white car speeding. “The driver upon seeing the officers stopped immediately near an informal settlement. “Two occupants exited the vehicle and the officers gave chase on foot.” Dyason said the perpetrators then fired two shots at the pursuing officers before they managed to escape into the night. When the officers search the abandoned  vehicle they found “ two people, bound and gagged in the boot of the car. Both appeared unconscious and were clearly viciously assaulted,” he said When one of the victims regained consciousness, he informed the officers they were on Monwabisi beach when they decided to go to a shop in Endlovini where they were taken captive by the perpetrators. The two were taken to a shack and assaulted. “The victims remembered the location of the shack they were held captive and took the officers there. “The shack was unoccupied but two cell phones and 15 packets of Tik were found.” Dyason confirmed that the victims did not want to lay any charges and were allowed to recover their cell phones and vehicle.
