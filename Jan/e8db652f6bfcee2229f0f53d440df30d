Cape Town: A 30-year-old trail runner has died after collapsing on the contour path below Devils Peak. Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR), which was busy with a separate incident Sunday, said they were alerted to the incident by another trail runner who ran around to call for assistance. A technical rescuer and two paramedics had been shorthauled by the helicopter as part of the other case and they were immediately flown to the collapsed runner. “Someone was already doing CPR. “This was not successful and the patient was declared dead on arrival. “The runner may have had a heart attack. “The results of a post-mortem should, however, be awaited. “The body of the deceased was extracted using the helicopter contracted to the Department of Health and handed to the Forensics Department of the SAPS. “Thereafter our rescue group and their training partners had a debrief. “We mourn the loss of this young man,” WSAR said. Meanwhile, the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company has urged people to exercise caution if they do anything outdoors at this time, including visiting the mountain. The mountain was expected to record its highest temperatures ever. Reneilwe Komape, a spokesperson for the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company, said: “From all predictions it looks like it is about to get even warmer here in the Cape. It is important to be careful and responsible when you do anything outdoors, such as visit the cableway. Please wear a hat, wear enough sunscreen, and ensure you have enough water with you. Keep in mind also that the weather can change very quickly on top of Table Mountain, so always take something warm with you. There can often be a big difference in the temperature when you get to the top, and cloud cover and cooler weather moves in faster than you think.” Cape Times
