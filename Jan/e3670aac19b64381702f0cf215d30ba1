CAPE TOWN – The 2021/22 summer fire season highlighted the crucial role of aerial support in extinguishing fires. The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment’s Working on Fire (WOF) programme had provided aerial support to more than 80 wildfires in the Western and Eastern Cape, including 25 Kishugu aircraft, from the Kishugu Group, that flew over 300 hours. WOF’s managing director, Trevor Abrahams, said Kishugu had an extensive pool of aerial resources readily available to clients. “We have the ability to provide the aerial resource of choice to our valued partners, including national, provincial and local government, fire authorities, fire protection associations (FPAs), environmental agencies and other landowners. Our existing mix of resources are selected based on the specific requirements of our clients and are strategically positioned for rapid initial attack. “Aerial resources are not a silver bullet and cannot extinguish fires as a stand-alone resource. “However, they are an essential element of fire suppression activities in support of ground teams.” Kishugu Aviation chief executive Emile Grobbelaar, said: “About 90% of wildfires are directly or indirectly started by people. That means if we all work together and act wisely and responsibly when it comes to fire, we can really make a difference for the greater good. Kishugu Aviation and the WOF teams always strive to effectively and efficiently save lives, properties, and the environment from wildfires.” To report fires, call 112 from a cellphone or 10177 from a landline Cape Times
