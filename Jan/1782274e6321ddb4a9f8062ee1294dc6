Cape Town - The Brackenfell police officer accused of raping a 26-year-old woman who sought assistance in a case of domestic violence at her home will appear in court today. The woman said the officer raped her at Bottelary farm in Stellenbosch after indicating that he would take her to her friend’s home in Kraaifontein. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate announced at the weekend that the suspect had been arrested after he returned to the Western Cape and that he would appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court. In a detailed interview with the Cape Argus, the woman said: “Last week Sunday, my partner and I had an argument which quickly got out of hand. I called the police, and two police officers came to the house.  “The officer who assaulted me brought up the idea that I should go over to a friend’s place instead of sleeping at home that night because I wasn’t safe staying behind on my own. He insisted on driving me there himself and manipulated the situation so that I would be alone with him so he could assault me with no witnesses. “Nothing could have prepared me for what happened later that night. To be assaulted like that by someone who is supposed to protect me there is no preparation for that kind of violation. I was terrified then, and I think a part of me will now always be scared. I am happy that he was arrested,” she said. The woman said she would not be in court today. “If I had the money, I think I would’ve gone. I want to know who he is, his name and surname. There is a sense of relief in knowing that he won’t be able to hurt me anymore at least not personally,” she said.
