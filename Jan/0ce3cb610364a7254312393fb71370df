DURBAN – The uMngeni Local Municipality is continuing its clean-up operations following recent storms and heavy rainfall in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. On Monday, the municipality and volunteers continued clearing trees that had been uprooted and damaged homes in the Zuzokuhle informal settlement. Volunteers went out with their chainsaws to assist victims of the recent storms. “The informal settlement was one of the many areas within our municipality that was damaged, with trees falling on homes and blocking access roads,” the municipality said. “It will be recalled that uMngeni Municipality has taken the decision to write to the national government requesting the area to be declared a local disaster. “This process has commenced and further updates will be provided in due course,” the municipality said. Meanwhile, the municipality said it managed to hire machinery it needed for the landfill site. Work began on Monday, with the clearing of the pertinent sites to allow for the dumping of green waste. “The hired machinery will also be utilised to further clear the entrance to the main dumping site,” the municipality said. It also said the department of community services head was researching long-term interventions from other municipalities in order to solve their problems. “Once again we apologise for any inconvenience caused, and will continue to try to improve the service offered at the Curry’s Post landfill site,” the municipality said.
