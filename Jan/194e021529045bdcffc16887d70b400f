CAPE TOWN - The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) says it hoped for the speedy recovery of a SAPS member who was filmed to be in a daze, displaying aggressive behaviour towards his colleagues on Thursday. The video has been shared widely on chat platforms, and shows the incident happening at the Mitchell’s Plain taxi rank. The identification of the officer is unknown and the officer was off duty at the time. Popcru spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said: “Such scenes are unfortunate and regrettable. We always believe there should be other conventional ways of resolving conflicts with colleagues and any other people. We wish the officer a speedy recovery.” Provincial police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said the officer was undergoing medical care. “The member has been referred to a medical facility for assistance, and while this aspect is being attended to, an internal investigation is underway,” said Swartbooi. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said they were not investigating the matter as it did not fall under their mandate. “The reason we say the matter does not fall under our mandate is because the officer seen assaulting his colleagues was wearing uniform off duty meaning he committed the assault not in the execution of his duties as outlined by the Ipid Act.” Cape Times
