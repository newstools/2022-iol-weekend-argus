A 62-year-old pensioner has been taken to hospital for medical attention after a brazen robber stabbed her in the arm and tried to strangle her at her home in Ottawa, Verulam, today. This comes after The Mercury’s sister publication Post reported that a Phoenix pensioner was strangled to death with the belt of her nightgown in her home in Eastbury on Monday evening. A cell phone was taken and according to a source while the motive for the crime is unknown, robbery could not be ruled out. Describing the Verulam incident, provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the woman was going to water her plants when she was accosted by an unknown man this morning. “The suspect forced her back into the house, stabbed her twice in the right hand arm and tried to strangle her,” she said. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), who were first at the scene said it received a call for assistance at 8:17am this morning after the pensioner sought assistance from neighbours. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said upon arrival, dispatched Rusa officers found the woman bleeding from stab wounds to her hand.  “A blood soaked piece of material was found tied around her neck. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her eyes due to being punched in the face,” said Balram.   Balram said the victim informed Rusa officers that as she entered her home after watering her plants,  the suspect walked in with her and began assaulting her. “He grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her before he attempted to strangle her. He then stole her cellphone and fled on foot,” he said. Balram said the suspect was known to the woman and had previously visited her and asked for handouts. Mbele said the suspect took two cell phones before fleeing the scene on foot. “The 62-year-old victim was taken to hospital for medical attention,” she said. Police said a case of house robbery was opened at Verulam police station for further investigation. THE MERCURY
