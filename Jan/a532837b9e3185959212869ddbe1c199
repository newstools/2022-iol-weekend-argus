CAPE TOWN - The South African Local Government Association Women’s Commission (SWC) has condemned the manhandling of Amathole District Municipality mayco member Nanziwe Rulashe, who was dragged across the floor of the City’s municipal offices in East London on Monday. In a video circulated widely on social media, Rulashe is seen being manhandled by security officials allegedly from the municipality’s head offices. The violence committed against Rulashe was unacceptable, SWC chairperson Flora Maboa-Boltman said. “The Amathole District Municipality incident demonstrates that patriarchal attitudes, often practised at home, have found their way to organisational settings, not just in local government, but in all other areas of public and economic life. This is an indication that the fight against GBV must be intensified in the workplace, and in broader society,” she said. “The SWC condemns the incident in the strongest possible terms and calls for the municipality to urgently conduct an investigation.” The SWC added that until more facts emerged, it would support women councillors. Amathole District Municipality Mayor Nceba Ndikinda said the matter would be investigated. “It is very sad to view and read about the alleged incident that took place in ADM head offices (on Monday). ADM council including the executive management distances itself from disturbing scenes circulating on social media platforms with the contempt it deserves,” Ndikinda said. “This matter will be fully investigated and as the executive mayor, I will act accordingly.” Cape Times
