Following the court appearance of Zandile Mafe on Tuesday in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court in connection with the fire in the Parliament building, many have taken to Twitter to show their support for the Khayelitsha man. The 49-year-old man who appeared disoriented as he entered the court, later denied and rejected the charges against him.  South Africans on Twitter shared their support for the alleged arsonist, saying he was innocent and that the story did not make sense. Twitter user @advovolicious said Mafe was a homeless man who was arrested and did not commit any crime. “He is innocent.  “When he is free he should sue the state for at least R100 million for unlawful arrest. #FreeZandileMafe ” Zandile Mafe is a homeless man who was arrested, he did not commit any crime he is innocent. They want to use him as a scapegoat this is what they did on Senzo Meyiwa's case. When he is free he should sue the state at least R100 million rand  for unlawful arrest.#FreeZandileMafe pic.twitter.com/gJ1Pya6G3y Twitter user @PitsoMokoena4 shared his support for Mafe saying he must be strong and that the public understood that he was not guilty. “Be strong my dear black brother.  “Your sin is to be poor, homeless and roaming around Parliament streets collecting food in the dustbin for survival.  “We know you didn’t do anything.” Be strong my dear Black Brother.
