A 46-year-old is under police guard at a medical facility following a beating from angry Kensington residents after he allegedly made off with a five-year-old child and bit him.  According to police, the suspect, who is known to the complainant, entered her residence and took her five-year-old grandson without her consent.  The incident took place shortly after 9.30am at a residence on the corners of 2nd Street and 4th Avenue.  Police spokesperson, Colonel Andre Traut said it was alleged that the suspect had a mental illness, and that he was cornered by neighbours when the complainant alerted them. “In the process the five-year-old boy sustained bite wounds, which were possibly inflicted by the suspect. “It is believed that the suspect, who is seemingly mentally challenged, was assaulted by the community before he was handed over to police. He is currently being detained at a medical facility while being treated. The young victim was also admitted to a medical facility for his wounds,” he said. Traut said cases of assault were being investigated.  Kensington Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Cheslyn Steenberg, appealed to the public to remain vigilant against crime. “I pray for a speedy recovery for those who sustained injury and for swift justice. Our children must be protected at all costs, this incident again reminds us that we have members of society that simply have no heart at all,” said Steenberg.
