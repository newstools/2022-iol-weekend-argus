Cape Town – Matric candidates who did not achieve their desired results have been encouraged not to give up. Western Cape education MEC Debbie Schäfer said there were options available. “There are measures in place to receive counselling for anyone who is disappointed with their results, either by approaching their school, which will put them in touch with the relevant people in the district offices or by phoning the Safe Schools Hotline on 0800 45 46 47. “Those that qualify for supplementary examinations must apply by February 18, 2022. Application forms will be available at schools and on the WCED website. “Learners can apply for remarks (R104 per subject) and rechecks (R25 per subject) until February 4, 2022. They can apply using the online service: http://www.eservices.gov.za/.

In addition, they also achieved a higher percentage of bachelor passes. “In 2021, quintile 3 schools achieved a pass rate of 75.8% and a bachelor pass rate of 32.5%, compared to quintile 4 with a 74.7% pass rate and a 30.2% bachelor rate.  “We will work with our quintile 4 schools over the coming year to ensure that they improve further as well,” she said. Schäfer said reduction in the inequality gap between quintile 4 to 5 schools and quintile 1 to 3 schools was significant. “We have worked hard to reduce this gap and the effort is paying off. “If we compare our performance from 2008, when the first NSC examination was written to today, our poorer schools have made great strides.  “The gap between the pass rate of quintile 1 to 3 schools and quintile 4 schools decreased from 12.4 percentage points to 1.6 percentage points.  “The gap between quintile 1 to 3 schools and quintile 5 schools reduced from 31.5 percentage points to 16.9 percentage points,” according to Schäfer.
