CAPE TOWN - An alleged gang of armed robbers who thought they made a clean hit after robbing a Caledon post office on Wednesday morning were later arrested in Hermanus. According to Western Cape police, at about 11am the suspects held the staff at the post office in Plein Street at gunpoint and fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash in a VW Golf. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said eager to bring in the perpetrators, police officer members pursued all avenues until the suspects were located and apprehended. “Investigation led the police to a residence in Zwelihle in Hermanus where the four suspects aged between 25 and 35 were arrested in possession of the stolen cash, as well as an unlicensed 9mm pistol,” he said. Traut said the getaway vehicle was also found and confiscated. Once charged, the suspects are expected to appear at the Caledon Magistrate's Court on charges including business robbery and the possession of an unlicensed firearm. In a separate incident,  Woodstock police members arrested a 33-year-old suspect, residing in the area, for the alleged possession of an unlicensed 9mm pistol without a serial number and ammunition. According to Traut, the officers had received information of suspicious armed individual at the Masekane informal settlement and reacted on it. “Once charged, he is expected to make his court appearance in Cape Town to face the charges against him.” Cape Times
