DURBAN - FLOUR and bread company Sasko has joined Gagasi FM to support its annual back-to-school campaign, Geleza Ne Gagasi 2022. The 14-year-old campaign, which loosely translated means “Study with Gagasi FM”, aids pupils in need. Station spokesperson Khulekani Shandu said the partnership of Sasko and Gagasi FM is one of shared values because through Geleza ne Gagasi, the company and the station will enrich and improve listeners’ lives as well as continue to demonstrate care. “Our partnership will ensure that the three groups within Geleza ne Gagasi are taken care of: Back to School, Back to Study and Adopt a School. Back to School is for learners at primary and high school level. Back to Study is for tertiary students.” He called on needy pupils to enter for selection by submitting their final academic results, along with a motivational letter stating why they deserved to receive assistance from Gagasi FM, in partnership with Sasko, adding that prizes included school uniform vouchers, stationery vouchers and bursaries. Shandu said this year’s campaign had added the “Adopt a School campaign” where the station and Sasko would support a deserving school. Daily News
