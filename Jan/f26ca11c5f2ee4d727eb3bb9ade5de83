CAPE Town and other parts of the province are in for extremely hot conditions as temperatures are expected to peak at 40ºC. The SA Weather Service (SAWS) has issued an advisory for extremely hot conditions as of Thursday that were expected to continue into Saturday evening. “Very hot conditions will result from predominantly light northerly wind flow over the interior of the Western Cape province.  “Temperatures reaching 40ºC and above are likely to occur over the Cape Winelands, Central Karoo, Kannaland and Oudtshoorn municipality,” says the advisory.  “Persistently high temperatures are expected into Friday in places over the Cape metropole, Drakenstein and Stellenbosch municipalities.” The advisory warned that if extreme heat occurred during a drought – a condition that still persists in parts of the Karoo – this can contribute to wildfires as it dries out vegetation. According to the past City of Cape Town, this past weekend saw thousands of residents and visitors flocking to pools and beaches to escape the heat and cool off – making it the busiest period in three years.  Those who will find themselves outside over the coming 48 hours, have been advised to: *  Avoid prolonged direct exposure to the sun as far as possible. * Drink plenty of water. * Limit strenuous outdoor activities. * Never leave children or animals in the car unattended. * Make sure animals have access to enough water.
