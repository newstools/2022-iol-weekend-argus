Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the attempted robbery happened just before midday. Mbele said it was alleged that a security guard, 30, was at business premises performing his duties when he was accosted by two armed men who were attempting to rob the shop. “The suspects opened fire, wounding the security guard in the abdomen, robbed him of his firearm and fled the scene on foot,” she said.

Police said charges of attempted murder and attempted robbery were opened at Montclair police station for investigation. Earlier this month The Mercury reported that robbers were spooked by an alarm and fled a business in Springfield Park during an attempted robbery. Police said three suspects entered the shop and demanded that the complainant open the safe. “An alarm went off and the suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle, leaving a backpack with 25 rounds of ammunition,” said police.
