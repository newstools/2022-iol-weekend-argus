Love is in the air and Cape Town artists Tye Platinum, Jarrad Ricketts, Robin Pieters, and Keanu Harker are among a group of artist who will be performing  at a special  Valentine’s Day event named Come Dine with LRI Productions. The romantic experience with some of the Mother City’s well known artists which includes a three-course meal paired with wine will be held at Infinity Studios in Paarden Island from noon to 7pm.  Chief executive LRI Productions  Lyle Irwin said they wanted to reignite the spirit of love for all those who were romantics by heart. “We will bring you a stunning afternoon of delicious food, as well as deliver the best soulful love music that will take fans back to the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s,” he said. He added: “We will even bring some of the latest chart-topping performances on stage.” Singer Tye Platinum said he felt privileged to be part of the production this year. “Being one of the acts that will contribute to celebrating love, in one of the best ways, is going to be amazing,” he said. “I can’t wait to be on stage with Cape Town’s greatest talents,” he added. “I am excited to be around people and perform for people again. Most of the gigs I’ve done were either online or pre-recorded.” Irwin said there wasn’t a more perfect time to host this event than in the month of love. “We are going to take the crowds back on a journey of Boys II Men, NSYNC and just bring back the sense of love.” He added: “If you’re single, who knows, we might be able to play Cupid on the day.” Irwin said they want to give the opportunity to artists to entertain crowds. “We are here for the people who love and enjoy music to come out and have a good time. This will give the artists a chance to earn an income in the pandemic especially.” Tickets are available on Quicket for R500 per person or R800 per couple.
