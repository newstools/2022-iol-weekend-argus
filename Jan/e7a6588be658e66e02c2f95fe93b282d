DURBAN: The power supply to Glenwood was restored yesterday while eThekwini Municipality expects parts of Umbilo, Sydenham, Sherwood and Westridge to be fixed today. This comes after the city said Glenwood, parts of Umbilo, Sydenham, Sherwood and parts of Westridge experienced power outages due to cable faults and faults on the network yesterday. Speaking to The Mercury today, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed that power had been restored in Glenwood. “Power has been restored in Glenwood. Our teams are still hard at work in the other affected areas. Complete restoration for these areas is expected by the end of the day,” he said. In an update yesterday, Glenwood councillor Sakhile Mngadi, said: “28 hours later and the power is back on everywhere… Thank you for being patient with me and the officials.” Mngadi previously said the 3-phase trip at the Glenwood Major 1830 substation caused a widespread blackout. Yesterday morning, the power came back and then went off again. Mngadi had suspected that fridges and geysers that were all off most of yesterday may have overloaded the circuits. While on site where the repairs were being done yesterday, Mngadi said the city was replacing a massive cable.   THE MERCURY
