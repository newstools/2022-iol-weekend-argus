Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandla Mandela has praised British actress Emma Watson for voicing her support in solidarity with Palestine and its struggles.  The Harry Potter star, known for her role as Hermione Granger, took to her Instagram account on Monday where she  shared an image of a pro-Palestinian activist march, edited with the words, ‘Solidarity is a verb’ over it. In the caption, Watson shared a quote by Sara Ahmed which read: “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same, or that our pain is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same future. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as well as the recognition that even if we do not have the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bodies, we do live on common ground.” The image was shared as a repost from the Bad Activist Collective Instagram account - an activist group that aims to dismantle perfectionism and fight for the liberation of people and the planet. In the past, Watson has been vocal about feminism and sexual harassment, speaking out in the time of the #MeToo movement. Nkosi Zwelivelile, grandson of former president, Nelson Mandela, said he saluted Watson for her courage to repost “solidarity is a verb” in support of the Palestinian struggle. “Apartheid Israel’s UN Envoy Gilad Erdan can apply all manner of sophistry but he cannot wish away Palestine and the just struggle of the Palestinian people.” He added: “Everyday justice and peace-loving people express their solidarity with the suffering of the Palestinian people under apartheid Israeli occupation.” Zwelivelile said that he salutes those who oppose the daily violation of basic human rights by apartheid Israel. “We say hands off Watson and all who stand in solidarity with the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement. Israel is an apartheid state and must be isolated in the international community of nations.”
