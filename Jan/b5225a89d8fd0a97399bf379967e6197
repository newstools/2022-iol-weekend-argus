CAPE TOWN - Alleged murder mastermind Ashley October, accused of murdering his ex-wife Charlene October, will remain behind bars after his bail application was denied at the Bredasdorp Magistrate’s Court this week. October and his co-accused, Taswill van der Rheede, appeared in court on Tuesday and are expected back in court next month as the matter continues. The State had opposed bail in the matter. This was supported by community members who had also opposed the release of both accused by means of petitions. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: "Van der Rheede and October appeared at the Bredasdorp Magistrate’s Court on 13 December 2021 and their case was postponed until 4 January 2022 for bail application for October. (Yesterday), October was denied bail and the matter was postponed till 3 February 2022 for typing of the bail record and further investigation." Charlene was found murdered in her home on July 12, a week after her birthday, while her granddaughter who she had been looking after overnight was spared during the attack. Charlene's son found her body when he arrived at her home. There was no answer at the door, but he heard the cries of his daughter in the house. The tuck shop on Charlene's home premises had been burgled. According to information, Ashley had been managing the tuck shop, while Van der Rheede was a family friend. Cape Times
