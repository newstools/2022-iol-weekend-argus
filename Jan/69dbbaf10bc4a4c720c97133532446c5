CAPE TOWN - MTN has been named the best mobile network in South Africa in the MyBroadband Insights annual 2021 Mobile Network Quality Report. The report ranks South Africa’s mobile networks and awards the best network in each major city. MTN reigned supreme in all major South African cities, with one exception - Vodacom had the best network in East London. The report is based on 1.35 million results from MyBroadband’s Speed Test App, which were recorded between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 40.86Mbps and an average upload speed of 13.82Mbps last year. MTN had the highest average download speed at 64.23Mbps, followed by Vodacom at 35.05Mbps, Telkom on 27.23Mbps, Cell C on 19.26Mbps and Rain on 13.07Mbps. MTN also had the best network in Johannesburg, Tshwane, eThekwini, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Gqeberha, Polokwane, George, and Kimberley. The only city where MTN did not reign supreme was East London, where Vodacom came out on top. “MTN’s exceptional performance results from outspending its rivals on infrastructure investment over the past five years. Vodacom has, however, started to outspend MTN last year and is keen to regain the top spot in the network quality rankings,” MyBroadband Insights said in a statement. A device analysis revealed that the peak speed of 751Mbps was achieved on a Huawei P40 Pro 5G, followed by 732Mbps on a Samsung Galaxy S21+ 5G and 695Mbps on a Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G.
