Seems like the Rohinga lot are being pressurized to restore a new democracy in the state by Theodoro Locksin of the Philliphines, who felt that Madame Aung San Suu Kyi is ’indispensable’ and must be included in this attempt to restore peaceful order and end the ’suffering of the civilian population’. Excuse me, I would like to know what was Madame Suu Kyi  doing to assist Rohinga refugees whilst she was president and dawdling with her ego on receiving the Nobel ’Peace’ prize not so long ago? Thousands of mainly Muslim refugees suffered (and are still suffering) after being booted out of their homes, only because of their religious faith! And that too from people that follow what is advertised as the most peaceful and non -violent religion in the world? Seems that these peace prizes are selectively awarded to mainly souls that actually do nothing for humanity or perhaps they are the usual diversionary methods adopted by western influences to keep us from looking too deeply in search for the truth. Or maybe the prize is to justify some terrible, callous act of war by sugar coating the perpetrator to an extent that insulates him from criticism?Obama and Libya are great examples! Anyway one looks at it, Suu Kyi is certainly not the best person to consult to help restore some decency in Myanmar. Ebrahim Essa, Durban. Daily News
