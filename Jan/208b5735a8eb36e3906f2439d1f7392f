DURBAN – Motorists travelling on the R617 in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Sunday night were given an unexpected “take away” after a cow caused a multiple-vehicle collision. Midlands EMS said paramedics were dispatched to the R617 for a multiple-motor vehicle collision at 8pm. Upon arrival, Midlands EMS said paramedics found two light motor vehicles had collided after hitting a cow that was walking in the road. “The injured cow was subsequently cut up and removed by motorists from passing vehicles and members of the community,” said Midlands EMS. Midlands EMS said paramedics assessed three patients at the scene. Late last year, IOL reported that goats attempting to run across the R102 highway caused a three-car pile up. One of the goats had unfortunately died and the National Council of SPCAs was called to assist the two injured goats that failed to cross when the ropes attached to their necks got entangled. Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) who were in attendance at the scene said while no one was injured during the accident, other animals were responsible for previous accidents on the same road. “The animals have caused near-fatal accidents in recent weeks, when motorists veered off the three-lane road in an attempt to avoid them. “Previously, a cow caused an accident on the same route near Coniston,” said Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram at the time.
