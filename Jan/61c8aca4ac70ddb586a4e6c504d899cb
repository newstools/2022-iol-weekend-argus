DURBAN - Local snake rescuer Nick Evans was called out to a school in Chatsworth on Tuesday to catch a big 2.3 metre black mamba, spotted on the school grounds. Evans said the person who called advised him that the snake had gone from the school grounds to the changeroom. He said the situation sounded "less than ideal“ and he rushed over to the school. “Upon arrival, I was relieved to see that all the students had already left the school. It was just the staff left, who had the situation under control,” he said. The mamba was hiding behind boards which the staff had placed up against the entrance to the changeroom, he said.   “Apparently, someone was walking down to the parking lot, when they saw the snake quite close to them, in the open. In its panic, it dashed up a shrub, then down and headed to these boards,” he said. Evans said the school grounds were not a place he would expect to find a mamba as it was very neat and sparse.  “There was a big patch of bush next to the school, so it was probably trying to get to the other side of the school in search of food, or maybe it just got a bit confused,” he said.   He said the rescue was quick, easy and uneventful. “[It was a] big mamba, about 2.3m, with a bit of the tail missing. Chunky snake! A great rodent controller.” Evans said the snake would be released away from the school.   THE MERCURY
