CAPE TOWN - The Presidency says Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu conceded that her words towards the country’s judiciary were inappropriate and has apologised following a meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa over her her recent article “Hi Mzansi, have we seen justice?” The two met  in Cape Town earlier this week, where Ramaphosa admonished Sisulu about the article. In a statement last night, the Presidency said Ramaphosa specifically admonished Sisulu about her ‘’attack’’ on the judiciary when she said: “Today, in the high echelons of our judicial system are those mentally colonised Africans, who have settled with the worldview and mindset of those who have dispossessed their ancestors. They are only too happy to lick the spittle of those who falsely claim superiority.The lack of confidence that permeates their rulings against their own speaks very loudly, while others, secure in their agenda, clap behind closed doors.” Sisulu has since  retracted this statement and affirms her support for the judiciary, said the Presidency, quoting Sisulu as saying: “I accept that my column has levelled against the judiciary and African judges in particular unsubstantiated, gratuitous and deeply hurtful comments. “I retract unequivocally my hurtful comments. I recognise that many women and men judges past and present have served their country in the judiciary with dedication and patriotism and some have made sterling sacrifices in the fight against apartheid and colonialism.I apologise for and regret the hurt I have caused the judiciary.” Cape Times
