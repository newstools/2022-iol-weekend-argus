DURBAN - ANGRY residents of Uganda informal settlement in uMlazi say they will not rest until justice is served after the death of a 21-year-old. Mfundo Phungula, a third-year Consumer Science student at the University of Zululand, was shot dead on Monday. SAPS Warrant officer Sizwe Myeni has been charged in connection with his murder and appeared in the uMlazi Magistrate’s Court yesterday. It is alleged that Phungula and his friend had gone to the residence of Myeni’s girlfriend to purchase liquor in the early hours, but were turned away by the couple. They proceeded to make a purchase at another store nearby. On their way back, they encountered Myeni with his girlfriend again and a shot was fired during the brawl that ensued. Phungula was rushed to Prince Mshiyeni Hospital, where he died shortly after arrival. His friend was not injured. The court yesterday heard that Myeni faces charges of murder and pointing a firearm. Testifying in the bail application, investigating officer Mthandeni Khoza said it was alleged that Phungula had been carrying a knife and had physically assaulted the accused’s girlfriend. He added that he did not oppose bail as Myeni had no previous convictions and had been co-operative throughout the investigation. Magistrate Nosipho Cele granted the accused bail of R2 000. Phungula’s friend, Thandolwethu Shange, said residents were not happy with the bail outcome. “Too many false stories are being said about our friend. Mfundo was in his third year and should have been graduating soon and now that won’t happen. We will not rest until justice is served,” said Shange. Myeni is due back in court on February 16.
