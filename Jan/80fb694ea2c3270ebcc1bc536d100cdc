Cape Town – The sentencing of a former Mitchells Plain sergeant who was found guilty of raping inmates has yet again been postponed, and activists are calling for the case to be finalised to give closure to the victims. David Steenkamp made an appearance at the Mitchells Plain Regional Court today where he heard his sentencing proceedings would only continue on February 9. In November, Steenkamp’s case could not move forward until they received the report from the probation office and correctional officer. The reports were later received. Steenkamp was convicted of one count of rape and three of sexual assault. The State proved that Steenkamp, who was stationed at Mitchells Plain police station, had raped and sexually attacked his victims, who were inmates. The incidents took place while Steenkamp had been on duty. Steenkamp was dismissed from the police in 2017. Activists have called for the sentencing to be finalised as the case has been on the court roll for years. Eric Ntabazalila of the National Prosecuting Authority said the case had been postponed. Women and children’s rights activist Barbara Rass, who runs a shelter for abused women and children called House of Healing, said cases such as this had to be placed as a priority on the court roll for victims to have a form of closure and justice, though they were left with a lifetime of pain. “Rape is inhumane. “It is emotional murder and if a person is found guilty, sentencing should be dealt with swiftly. Rape is rape, and to steal a person’s body is worse than stealing a packet of sugar, you can replace that sugar but you cannot replace that body, that victim has to live with it. The sooner they act, the sooner the victim can get healing. The victim suffers mental trauma,” she said. Weekend Argus
