Cape Town - Ravensmead police are investigating the murder of a 30-year-old man, after they attended a crime scene near Beverley Court, Pinedene Street, in Ravensmead, on Sunday. Provincial police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said: “Upon arrival at the scene police found the body of an unknown man who sustained stab wounds to his neck. The victim was declared dead by medical personnel. The motive for the attack is unknown. The unknown suspect/s fled the scene in an undisclosed direction and are yet to be arrested.”  Pastor Adam Alexander from the Outreach Baptist Church in Ravensmead said: “I know the victim personally and his father died less than a month ago. The victim was a friendly and respectable young man. The saddest part is that I saw him on Saturday. He was looking healthy and happy as always. “We need stricter laws in place. The justice system is against us as it protects criminals. I believe the system is corrupt and that’s why people find it easy to take someone’s life. I hope the person who took the life of this young man will be dealt with and given the toughest sentence possible, not just his but all other killings and murders,” he said. Public relations officer at Ravensmead community policing forum (CPF) Zelda Trantraal said that during the festive season people tend to consume more alcohol and tend to get into fights/violence. “(I am) not saying this is the case here, but the period between Christmas and New Year is mostly such a time. People must really become more responsible in dealing/handling arguments or conflict. “The community must come together and take a stand against violence and crime. Perpetrators must be jailed and punished. To take someone’s life just like that can never be accepted,” she said. Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stop on 08600 10111. | Weekend Argus
