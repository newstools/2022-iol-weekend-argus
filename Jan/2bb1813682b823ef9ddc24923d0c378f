CAPE TOWN - The City is offering a reward of R5 000 for information that leads to the arrest of those responsible for the stoning of a brand new train set. Metrorail had reported on December 4 that a group of youths stoned the train at Steenberg station en route to Fish Hoek. As a result, the driver’s cabin window was damaged, with repairs expected to cost around R20 000, the City said. A case of malicious damage to property has since been reported to police. Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said he has engaged with Metrorail and confirmed the incident where a window on the brand new Southern Line train was broken due to stone throwing on its first day of operation. “Damage to critical infrastructure is completely unacceptable, even if it is perpetrated by youth who think that stoning trains is “fun”. For too long, a well-functioning rail service has been absent from our city, and millions of Capetonians suffer as a result.” Hill-Lewis said Capetonians end up having to spend more of their income on other forms of public transport, and take longer to get to work and back home due to the absence of trains. “We cannot allow a few individuals who wish to damage and steal public infrastructure to rob us of all of the resources we need to improve our lives. "When the trains run again, after long absences and very expensive investment, we should all help to protect them.” Anyone who has information on the incident can anonymously contact the Public Emergency Call Centre on 107 from a landline and 021 480 7700 from a cell phone. Alternatively, contact 080 021 0081. Cape Times
