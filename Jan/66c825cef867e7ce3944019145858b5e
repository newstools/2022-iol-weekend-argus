Cape Town – A police investigation is ongoing to establish the motive behind the fatal shooting of a 27-year-old man in Bonteheuwel.  This comes after police responded to a shooting incident in Loganberry Street on Wednesday night where the body of a man was discovered.  Police spokesperson, Sergeant Wesley Twigg said the incident occurred at around 10pm. “Bishop Lavis police attended to a complaint of a shooting incident and upon arrival on the scene found the victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. “The victim was declared deceased on the scene by medical personnel. “The suspect/s fled the scene and are yet to be arrested,'' said Twigg. Twigg said a murder docket had been registered for investigation.  Councillor for ward 50, Angus McKenzie alleged that this was a gang-related incident and sent his condolences to the family. He emphasised that gangsterism needed to be rooted out in the communities. “The shooting that took place was gang-related, and the loss of any life is tragic and a heartbreaking experience. While we send our deepest condolences to the family, let us never forget the terror (that) these individuals bestow upon our communities. “Concerns still remain now for a threat of retaliation. Our teams will monitor this situation closely,” he said. Just three weeks ago Nicky Jacobs, 29, was struck by a bullet after allegedly being caught in the crossfire of two rival gangs, the Funkies and the Playboys, in Citrus Street, Bonteheuwel, while walking with her five-year-old daughter. Around 12 hours later, the body of an 18-year-old boy was found on the same street having been shot and killed.
