Cape Town -  Cape Town municipal manager Lungelo Mbadazayo was arrested for speeding near Swellendam on the N2 highway. He was nabbed by provincial traffic officials for exceeding a speed limit of 100km/h by over 56km/h on January 15. Mbandazayo is believed to have been travelling from the Eastern Cape when he was caught by a speed camera placed by traffic officials on the side of the road. The breach of 156 km/h in a 100 km/h zone was recorded as the second highest speeding incident by provincial traffic officers in the week of January 10-16. It is alleged that Mbadazayo spent a night at the police cells and was released the following day after interventions by certain individuals. Southern Cape police spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie confirmed the arrest of a 60-year-old individual and said he was expected to appear in court yesterday.  “The matter was postponed in absentia as his legal representative liaised with the National Prosecuting Authority.  The matter is  scheduled to be back at court on 23 February 2022.” The Weekend Argus  asked the city if it was aware of the arrest and if it would be taking disciplinary action against the manager.  “Although the city of Cape Town has knowledge of an incident that occurred in Swellendam involving the city manager, Swellendam falls outside of the city’s jurisdiction,” said spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo. Please contact the relevant municipality and SAPS.“ In council yesterday it was revealed that there was an acting municipal manager.  “Where is the municipal manager?” asked opposition leader Xolani Sotashe. “We cannot be told there is an acting municipal manager without being told what happened to him.”  Tyhalibhongo said the municipal manager was on leave.  “The city manager has been on annual leave this week. As is required by law, during this week, there has been an acting city manager. The city manager returns from leave on Monday.”  Weekend Argus
