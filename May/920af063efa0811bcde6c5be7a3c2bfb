DURBAN – KwaZulu-Natal’s department of human settlements has revealed that only 108 temporary residential units out of the nearly 5 000 sites required after the recent floods have been delivered to date. The human settlements portfolio committee was informed of this at a meeting recently. A report indicated that the delivery pace was slow especially in eThekwini, Ugu and Kwadukuza municipalities, as there are soil- related issues as well as sites not being suitable for building. The department says it is aiming to deliver 1 170 (23%) temporary houses by the end of July. The DA says it is alarmed by this latest information.  “Our province is facing a major crisis, particularly as winter approaches and the threat of another Covid-19 surge looms. “In eThekwini – the epicentre of the floods – where the requirement for temporary housing is the highest with 3 000 units, only 1% (21) temporary housing units have been delivered and just 600 (20%) procured to date,” said the DA’s KZN spokesperson on human settlements, Marlaine Nair. Despite the slow pace in delivery, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala has continuously affirmed that all families staying in halls and shelters are to be re-homed.
