POLICE are investigating the cause of a shack fire that killed a 2-year-old girl in Samora Machel. The incident occurred shortly before midnight on Saturday, where the toddler was said to be left at home with her 13-year-old sibling. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said the victim died on the scene. “Samora Machel police attended a crime scene just before midnight on Saturday. Upon arrival, they found a shack on fire. “The fire brigade was called to extinguish the fire. Further inspection led to the recovery of the body of a 2-year-old baby girl. The victim was declared deceased on the scene by the medical personnel. Samora Machel police registered an inquest for further investigation,” said Swartbooi. Councillor Bongani Maqungwana said the community was shocked by the toddler’s tragic death.  It is unclear where the children’s mother was at the time of the incident, but residents said the 13-year-old ran out of the shack to alert the community of the blaze.  “It is shocking (that something like this can happen in our community). We will meet (on Tuesday at noon) with the community to discuss this matter,” he said. The incident comes after five family members, including two children aged four and five, were killed in a fire at the France Informal Settlement in Site B, Khayelitsha, last week on Sunday. On Saturday, brothers Juane Ray, 4, and Xache Weideman, 7, were laid to rest in Bishop Lavis after they died in a shack fire on May 5.
