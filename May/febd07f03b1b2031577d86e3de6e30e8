A POLICE officer has been detained at the Bellville police station after he shot and killed two people on Monday night in Kraaifontein. Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) spokesperson Lizzy Suping confirmed the detention and said the shooting incident took place inside the house. “Ipid is investigating the case in question where it is alleged that on Monday, May 23, at about 6.30pm, a police officer visited his family at Kraaifontein, Bloekombos. An altercation allegedly broke out between the suspect and a resident at the house in Bloekombos and led to the suspect killing two people,” said Lizzy Suping. Suping said the motive for the murders was still under investigation. A community activist who asked to stay anonymous said they were made aware of the incident and called for the law to take it course. “We condemn such behaviour. It is disappointing that it is being done by people who are supposed to uphold the Constitution. We cannot have incidents like these in our DNA age. We call for a harsh sentence against the officer,” he said. The incident comes after a Cape Town law enforcement officer was released on bail in January for allegedly shooting and killing a homeless man in Rondebosch. The 22-year-old officer was arrested for the case of murder after reportedly shooting the man in the face during an altercation. It was understood that the officer was responding to a complaint that a homeless resident had started a fire in Chester Road.
