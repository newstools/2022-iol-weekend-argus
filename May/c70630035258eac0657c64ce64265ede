WHILE the beleaguered state-owned power utility Eskom will implement stage 1 load shedding from 5pm to 10pm on Saturday and Sunday, the City of Cape Town customers will  not be affected.    The City said it customers will not experiencing blackouts this weekend.  Eskom on Saturday announced that load shedding was reduced from stage 2 to stage 1.  The power supplier warned in a statement on Saturday  against an increased risk of load shedding in the coming weeks if the shortage of electricity supply continues. Load shedding affected  SA Menswear  Fashion Week in Claremont on Friday evening when the organisers of the event had to rely on cellphone torches for lightning.  At this stage, Eskom has to keep the lights on without 4 279 megawatts (MW) due to planned maintenance work and an additional 15 943 MW due to unplanned interruptions. "We call on all South Africans to help reduce the impact of the electricity constrains by reducing the usage of electricity and by switching off all non-essential items." The power supplier emphasised that load shedding is only implemented as a last resort. "The system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of loadshedding over the coming weeks," Eskom said in a statement. Earlier this month, Eskom cut around 4000 MW of power in a   Stage 4  outage - some of the worst power cuts in more than a decade, while this weekend's cuts were categorised as Stage 1, or 1000 MW.
