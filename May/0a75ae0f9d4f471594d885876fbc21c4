Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed former president Jacob Zuma’s spin doctor Vincent Ngwenya as his new spokesperson.  Magwenya’s appointment was announced this afternoon by the presidency, and he will start in his new position tomorrow.  The President's spokesperson position has been vacant for almost two years after the removal of Khusela Diko following a controversy involving her late husband’s involvement in companies that benefited from PPE procurement by the Gauteng department of health.  Although Diko was never found guilty, she was found to have failed to disclose her interests in other entities.  Since July 2020, Tyrone Seale has been an acting spokesperson. Magwenya used to be Zuma’s spokesperson from 2009 to 2010. He quit the job after he was allegedly sidelined on major developments surrounding the then president. He was CEO of the PR agency Magna Carta from 2013 to 2016. The seasoned communicator also started Conversations Media and Communications, where he has served as CEO. Magwenya also served as Director of Communications for Standard Bank Africa and Director of Group Stakeholder Relations Management for Standard Bank Group.  He started his career as a broadcast journalist in various technical and editorial roles and worked for international & local broadcasters such as Reuters TV, Worldwide Television News (now Associated Press Television News), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the SABC. President Ramaphosa said: “I am pleased to welcome Vincent Magwenya to the Presidency team. His experience, insight and capabilities will strengthen our efforts to effectively communicate the work of the Presidency as we undertake the work of recovery and rebuilding.” He also expressed gratitude to Seale for having acted in the position of spokesperson to the President since July 2020.  “His capable manner and dedication to the task has been widely acknowledged and is much appreciated,” President Ramaphosa said.
