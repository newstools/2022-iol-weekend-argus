CAPE Town - Two suspected gang members were arrested with a firearm containing ammunition belongings to the SAPS in Kraaifontein yesterday. The City’s LEAP officers were in Joseph Avenue when they came across two men and discovered a Norinco firearm and ammunition in one of the suspects’ possession. Western Cape interim deputy leader JP Smith said: “Preliminary investigations suggest that the firearm could have been stolen in 2021 within the Joostenberg Vlakte area and will now be sent for ballistic testing to see if it can be linked to previous crimes.  “Further questioning had the suspect reveal that he was in fact on his ‘way to go and shoot’ rival gangs. “Another firearm removed off our streets is yet another victory and makes up for several firearms recovered each week across the various teams within the directorate,” he said. Chairperson of the Kraaifontein Community Police Forum (CPF), Robert Bisset, said: “We as (the) CPF will work with SAPS in cleaning up the community streets. There are a lot of youngsters on the street getting involved in wrong things.  “My view is that the Department of Police Oversight and Community Safety and the City should provide CPF with more funds. (This will help us) get kids involved in sports, games, music and things to (help them) grow,” he said.  Police spokesperson, Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “This office can confirm that this morning, two suspects aged 17 and 19 were arrested in Joseph Avenue, Scottsdene, Kraaifontein on possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition charges. They are due to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s court once charged.” Weekend Argus
