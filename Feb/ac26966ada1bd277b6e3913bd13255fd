Cape Town - A 35-year-old man was shot and killed at the Langa taxi rank in what is believed to be related to rivalry within the taxi industry.  The incident happened just after 7am during the morning rush on Tuesday morning as commuters and school children were going to work and school. According to eyewitnesses, a bakkie drove past with  an armed man who got out and started firing shots at the victim. People started running for cover and the suspect fled on foot. “The circumstances surrounding a shooting incident this morning at about 07.30am at a taxi rank in Langa, where a 35-year-old male was shot and fatally wounded are under investigation,” said police spokesperson Sergeant Wesley Twigg “Langa police were called to the scene where they found the victim with a gunshot wound to the head. The victim was declared deceased on the scene by medical personnel.” “The suspect/s fled the scene and are yet to be arrested.” Videos circulating on social media show the aftermath of the shooting. People are seen running while others stare at the body of the deceased. School children with backpacks can be seen walking past the body.  Langa CPF chairperson Alfred Magcwaca condemned the shooting and called for calm while the police try to find the perpetrators. “We do not know what really happened but we condemn the shooting. It happened in front of school children and while people were preparing for work.” “The community is anxious now and rightfully so because these shootings happen randomly. We will meet with the minibus taxi officials to discuss this and they must guarantee the safety of commuters.” Anyone with any information about this incident can contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
