Cape Town: The refreshing outdoors, breathing in fresh air and swimming in the cold Atlantic Ocean will keep a group of swimmers motivated for a good cause. Tyla Lakay, along with her coaches Geoff Fall and Jon Vickers, will swim from Robben Island to Big Bay Surf Lifesaving Club to raise funds for Milnerton High School families in need. The trio will set off on the 7.4km journey this month. Tyla said it is very important to pay it forward and help the less fortunate. “Covid-19 had a negative impact on so many people, including loss of jobs and income. Families did not have food on the table and if I can help to place a meal on someone's table that's what I'm going to do. I live to serve and that is why I thoroughly enjoy doing my volunteer lifeguard duty at  Big Bay Surf Lifesaving Club ,” said the Grade 10 pupil at Milnerton High School. Referring to the event, Tyla said she is hoping for great weather conditions and to complete the charity swim. “I've always enjoyed an open water swim. There is nothing more refreshing than the outdoors, breathing in fresh air and swimming in the cold Atlantic Ocean,” she said. The teacher responsible for the Interact Society at Milnerton High School, Angela Snyman, said Tyla is a very special and brave young lady. “At a young age she already understands the hardships of life and wants to help. A lot of people in our communities are battling financially. Children cannot learn on an empty tummy and it also affects them emotionally. We cannot rely on the state to provide assistance to everybody and private organisations and individuals must intervene to provide assistance. We focus to assist the families within our school community who are experiencing financial difficulties,” she said. Weekend Argus
