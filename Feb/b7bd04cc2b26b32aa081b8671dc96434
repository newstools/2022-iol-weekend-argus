CAPE TOWN - Knysna municipality’s acting municipal manager Dawid Adonis has tendered his resignation in the municipality and will be taking up the position of municipal manager at the Cederberg Municipality in March. Adonis was appointed to the position in December 2020, after the second term of the previous acting municipal manager, Louis Scheepers, came to an end. Knysna mayor Levael Davis, who received Adonis’s resignation letter last Thursday, thanked him for his service to the people of greater Knysna. Adonis had started his career in local government at the Knysna Municipality as manager for Integrated Human Settlements, before becoming the Director for Community Services. He said on Monday he was excited to lead the administration in Cederberg and to assist the council to become financially viable. “There is a massive amount of challenges with infrastructure backlogs. Knysna Municipality gave me great support during my 14 years of employment in the municipality. I am very thankful to Knysna and believe that I am leaving a legacy behind,” said Adonis. Cederberg mayor Ruben Richards confirmed the appointment, saying Adonis outperformed other candidates in terms of all the competency tests and interview process. His last working day at the municipality will be on February 25,  and he is expected to start in the Cederberg municipality on March 1. Plaaslike Besorgde Inwoners (PBI) Knysna councillor Alberto Marbi said they believe Adonis will be a major asset to Cederberg, as he was to Knysna  for the past few years. “On behalf of the PBI, I want to wish Dawid Adonis well with his future endeavours and believe that he will be a major asset to Cederberg as he was to Knysna Municipality for the last couple of years.  “With his management skills Knysna has managed to fast track the backlog in housing where he was manager of Integrated Human Settlements. This is indeed a great loss to Knysna but we wish him well in his future endeavours,” Marbi said. Cape Times
