Cape Town - A new Cape Town internet, TooMuchWifi, which aims to bring affordable wi-fi to townships while hiring previously unemployed people from these townships, has pledged to support communities by offering scholarships to learners who lost their parents in communities served by the provider. The internet provider awarded its Gato Thomson scholarship to two academically gifted high school learners – Ithinathi Khusela from Langa, and Asemahle Gama from Khayelitsha – to attend UCT’s private online high school. The scholarship honours TooMuchWifi CEO Ian Thomson’s father, whose parents died when he was 13, and the community that supported him. Thomson’s wife and partner, Ceylan Thomson said: “On top of having their school fees paid, the students will each receive a laptop, an uncapped internet line, and all the other materials they’ll need to complete their coursework.” Thomson’s father would also provide mentorship to the girls in their efforts to succeed in their studies without parental support, and during their school holidays they would also be able to take part in TooMuchWifi’s paid internship programmes. Gama and Khusela were grateful for the opportunity and dreamt of becoming doctors to help people across the world. Ceylan said they hoped to double up the scholarships offered every year, and therefore planned to sponsor four scholars next year. UCT Online High School principal Yandiswa Xhakaza said: “We’re incredibly happy to see companies supporting new and innovative education offerings such as the UCT Online High School to fund learners of their selection. We wish the learners a prosperous and successful future.” kristin.engel@inl.co.za Cape Argus
