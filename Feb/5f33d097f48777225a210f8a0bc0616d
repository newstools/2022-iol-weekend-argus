DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education is in support of the provincial education portfolio committee conducting oversight visits a schools following reports of teachers fighting at a school in the Zululand District. It is alleged that teachers there fight amongst themselves in front of the pupils. According to the KZN legislature more information and the facts surrounding the issue would be known soon. Education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said although the department is dealing with  the matter, it was also the portfolio committee’s responsibility to represent the citizenry of this province. “It is expected that when they hear such a thing they still get the facts so that they can take the citizenry of the province into confidence that the situation has been normalised, and that there have been consequences to uproot and prevent such an occurrence,” said Mahlambi. The committee will conduct physical inspection during an oversight visit to the school on Saturday, February 12, 2022. The committee has resolved to conduct its oversight work by visiting the school and observing the ‘disturbing’ incidents reported and provided to the committee. Committee chairperson Sifiso Sonjica said they were shocked at behaviour of educators at the school. “The report is appalling beyond anyone's imagination that teachers who we know should be exemplary to our children would do such.” “Unconfirmed reports (indicate a ) of lack of necessities such as water, electricity, grass not being cut at a school with just under 150 pupils, with 13 classrooms but only five educators,”  Sonjica said, adding that the portfolio committee members would like to see the conditions at the school for themselves .
