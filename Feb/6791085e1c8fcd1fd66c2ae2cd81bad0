Lwazi Sibindana, the man who had been on the run after allegedly setting his girlfriend alight, is choosing to stay behind bars. Sibindana made an appearance at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court yesterday where he is facing a charge of murder relating to his girlfriend, Jaqueline Mpontsana’s death last year September. The State is set to prove that Sibindana set Mpontsana alight during a domestic dispute inside his home in Gugulethu and then went on the run. He was found hiding at a residence in Khayelitsha in January. This was after the Department of Community Safety offered a R5000 reward for information about his whereabouts after the brutal murder. Eric Ntabazalila of the National Prosecuting Authority confirmed Sibindana decided not to continue his bail application. He will remain behind bars for the continuation of his case. “Lwazi Sibindana appeared at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court yesterday morning. He is charged with the murder of Jacqueline Mpontsana. He abandoned his bail application and his case has been postponed until May 6 for further investigation.” Mpontsana had been employed by the Department of Community Safety where part of her responsibilities were to assess police station compliance in terms of the Domestic Violence Act.
