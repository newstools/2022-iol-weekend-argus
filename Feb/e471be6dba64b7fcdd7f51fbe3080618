Therefore, essence cosmetics in collaboration with Clean C are inviting you to be cleaner and greener with us in 2022! Clean C hosts beach clean-ups on a regular basis around Cape Town. Their aim is to keep our beaches and oceans free from litter and safe for all to enjoy. The clean-ups are a wonderful opportunity for families, kids and companies to get involved and do their bit in helping look after our environment. To celebrate another year on this planet, at essence we would like to show our gratitude by coming together to help keep our beaches and environment clean. Clean and green is important to us, we care about a happy planet for future generations. We look forward to making a positive change with you by our side and having you help us in creating a better environment for all. Hope to see you there!
