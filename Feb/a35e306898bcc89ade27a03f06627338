The Western Cape government announced the launch of a R50 million support programme in the form of job opportunities to municipalities in the coming months. Western Cape minister of local government, environmental affairs and development planning, Anton Bredell made the announcement in his address during the State of the Province Debate. All 24 local municipalities and the metro have submitted business plans. The department of local government will transfer funds to municipalities from March, Bredell said. The Stats SA Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS), released in August,  said the Western Cape unemployment stands at 25.8%. The R50 million investment is estimated to create 3247 short term jobs. Bredell said the project also makes provision for the district municipalities of the West Coast, Cape Winelands, Overberg, Garden Route and the Central Karoo. “These play a supporting role in the administration, monitoring and reporting on individual projects. Each district municipality will receive R200 000 to fulfil this role. Bredell said the project was a way for people to put food on the table for those who   most in needed of it. “The R50 million will support existing and new Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) projects throughout the province,” he said. He added: “This investment will also stimulate entrepreneurship and skills development in affected communities.” Bredell said EPWP projects contribute towards making towns more attractive. “Projects like cleaning up public spaces, community safety and alien clearing in river courses, will contribute to making towns more attractive for investment and future job creation,” he said.
