Cape Town - Bonteheuwel sisters, Lisa and Anathi Booysen, triumphed above their adversities. More than a year ago the duo started a business to not only help them through their studies, but also to create jobs for those who were unemployed and  had lost their jobs, due to Covid-19. They came up with a simple business idea called Waxout Window Wipers, where they would go around the community to wash and clean businesses and residents windows along with their new recruits. Their business is doing so well that they are thinking of expanding to roof cleaning and general cleaning services. Lisa said they think of their business as tomorrow's big thing . “The idea did not only come from our passion for cleaning but mostly from the fact that we used to clean our pastor's house windows. What makes Waxout Window Wipers unique is that it's run by us young ladies, because people have this mentality that only men own local businesses. That we are breaking that rule and washing windows is something that people take for granted. Plus our business is local and it's something that has never happened in Bonteheuwel.” Bonteheuwel ward councillor, Angus McKenzie, said he was immensely proud and really excited about what the women were doing. “We promised to create a safer community which would allow local entrepreneurs to thrive. It really is a culmination of what we all have been working hard for in Bonteheuwel. “In an ever evolving world, specifically driven by Covid those that think out of the box will succeed. The normal industries and normal way of doing things will never deliver the results that hard-working entrepreneurial minded individuals will achieve. “Every person has an idea, Bonteheuwel offers a market of over 80 000 people. Not having a job should never be an excuse for not implementing an idea you have. If you never try, you'll never know,” he said. Weekend Argus
