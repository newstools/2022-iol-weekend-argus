DURBAN – uMlazi police are investigating the murders of two ANC members at the weekend. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said at 6.30pm on Saturday, a 51-year-old man was standing on Baker Road with other men who had come from a meeting when four men approached them. The four men suddenly opened fire on the group. “Unfortunately, a 51-year-old man and a 35-year-old man sustained multiple gunshot wounds. They were both declared dead at the scene. Others managed to flee,” Gwala said. She said the motive of the killing had yet to be established. The SABC reported that the ANC branch secretary in uMlazi, Thulani Shusha, and another ANC member were shot and killed by unknown men on Saturday. In an interview, a relative, Themba Mkhize, said Shusha was killed by people within the ANC for reasons only they knew. “They know why they did it but nothing remains hidden forever. In time and with proper investigation, the truth will come out and it will comfort us,” Mkhize said. ANC member Sthenjwa Nyawose said they believed those who killed the two men were following and monitoring them. Since the start of the year, two other ANC politicians have been shot dead in eThekwini. Former eThekwini ANC ward councillor Bheki Mvubu was killed on his way home in February while Minenhle Mkhize was also gunned down at his home in January. Daily News
