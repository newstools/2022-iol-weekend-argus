Cape Town - Africa’s largest contemporary art fair, Investec Cape Town Art Fair, is returning to its physical home for a hybrid event at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from February 18 to 20.  With more than 98 local and international exhibitors from 20 countries, including 17 first-time participants taking part in the ninth edition of the art fair, visitors can look forward to extras that come with attending the fair in person, such as hosted debates, a bookshop, a space to hang out with artists and curators, drink bubbly or grab something South African from Crystal Birch, Pichulik, Marigold, Missibaba or Moonbasket at the fair’s inaugural pop-up store. As the theme for this year's cultural highlight in the Mother City is Connect through Art from Africa and the World, the fair aims to showcase undiscovered talent, especially talent from Africa. The art fair, according to Investec Cape Town director Laura Vincenti, will enter a new, buoyant era by utilising the sophisticated Art Shell digital podium as an adjunct to the convention centre space. “It’s an understatement to say that the world of culture has shifted. The global pandemic has forced our experience of art to change and adapt, and after an unusual social and emotional emptiness of two years due to the global lockdown, artists, exhibitors, their gallerists and dealers, but perhaps even more importantly, the art-loving public and collectors can look forward to an exhilarating experience once again at the Art Shell, as it will offer an intimate online curatorial experience between viewers and artworks, collectors and exhibitors," said Vincenti. Organisers have also ensured that the experience doesn’t stop at the CTICC, so whether you’re taking a walk, enjoying a talk or an evening bus tour of the Mother City’s most vibrant galleries, organisers have made sure that visitors experience this year’s Investec Cape Town Art Fair, following Covid-19 protocols.
