The theatre adaption of Nobel Prize-winning author JM Coetzee’s Life & Times of Michael K will premiere at the Baxter Theatre on Monday. The multi-layered theatrical production consists of puppetry, performance, film and evocative music which helps bring the novel to life. The work is co-production between the Baxter Theatre and Germany’s Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus Theatre Company. The story follows Michael K on a journey through South Africa, ravaged by civil war. Upon returning to his dying mother on the farm where she was born, Michael finds strength in his humanity. In doing so, his connection to the earth and his unique path unfolds to him, his reason for living. In collaboration with the Handspring Puppet Company, the show was adapted for the stage by Lara Foot. The show, which would have premiered last year, was postponed due to the pandemic and stringent lockdown restrictions. The production sees some of South Africa’s most revered, multi-award-winning artists return to stage and it took more than two years of planning to bring to life.  Foot worked alongside Tony-award winning Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler from the hit production War Horse-fame, along with the cast and creative team. The South African cast includes theatre legends Sandra Prinsloo, Andrew Buckland, Faniswa Yisa, puppet master Craig Leo, Roshina Ratnam, Carlo Daniels, Marty Kintu, Billy Langa and Nolufefe Ntshuntshe. The creative team includes Handspring Puppet Company, set designer Patrick Curtis   and Kyle Shepherd original music composition. All Covid-19 protocols are in place as regulated by lockdown restrictions. Patrons and audience members are advised to arrive at least an hour before the start of the performance to avoid delays. Booking can be done through Webtickets or at Pick n Pay stores.
