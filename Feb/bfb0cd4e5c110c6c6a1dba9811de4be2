HUNDREDS of mourners gathered to pay their last respects to murdered Klawer teen, Jerobejin van Wyk who was buried on Saturday.  Family, friend and residents filled the Klawer hall where the 13-year-old’s funeral took place. The teen’s remains were found in a drain on the property of train drive Daniel Smit two days after he had been reported missing. He and a friend had been picking mangoes on the  h property.  Smit has since been charged with murder, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and defeating the ends of justice.  After Smit spotted them picking mangoes he allegedly pursued Jerobejin and his friend in his bakkie. He  allegedly knocked Jerobejin down, put him in his bakkie before driving off. Jerobejin’s family and friends wore T-shirts and face masks with picture’s of the boy’s face printed on them. They were inconsolable as his small white casket was carried into the hall accompanied by a marching band. His mother Triesa van Wyk was held by relatives as she sobbed at the sight of her son’s coffin.  Councillor Jan Koopman  asked the community to keep the mother in their prayers as she continued to be plagued by the questions  to as why her son was murdered.  Koopman added that it was a sad moment for the town as it has been placed on the map for such a tragic event.  At the hall, 13 candles were lit in memory of the teen - each candle representing a year of his life. Smit is expected back in court on April 26 after his case was postponed for further investigation. His lawyer has since released statements alluding to the fact that her client had been in a cult group as a teenager, and that evil spirits made him kill the boy.
