Cape Town - A home invasion cost a Durbanville family close to a half a million rand in losses after they were awakened by intruders in their home in Sonstraal Heights, yesterday.  The suspects also fled with their Toyota Fortuner. Marchell Rhode from Durbanville police said the couple were threatened with a knife by one of the suspects, who demanded money from them. “They then asked about the safe and threatened to kill the husband if they did not show where the safe was. The suspects took cellphones, a laptop, money from the safe, TV and fled with their family vehicle. “According to the complainant, the suspects gained entry by forcing an open window. At this stage no suspects have been arrested. A house robbery will be investigated by Durbanville police. The community must be aware not to keep large amounts of cash at home or in their safes,” he said. Acting provincial Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Fransina Lukas said a good relationship among neighbours was important. “The role of neighbours is to be the eyes and ears of  the police in cases when the property of a neighbour is under threat of theft. As neighbours we look out for each other's property.  “Always alert your neighbours when you are not at home for long and short periods of time in order for the neighbour to  look out for any intruders and trespassers at your property,” she said. Western Cape police spokesperson  Colonel Andrè Traut said: “There are no new developments regarding the investigation at this stage.” Weekend Argus
