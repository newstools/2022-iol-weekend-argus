DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza, Finance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube and Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane will launch a ground-breaking initiative, Mother and Daughter High Tea dialogue on Tuesday at the Coastlands Hotel. This legacy project is aimed at fostering unity, sustaining the positive mood among women, bridging the gap between generations and sharing ideas for women to better their lives. The High Tea dialogue championed by the Department of Social Development, will bring together women from all walks of life to ensure women empowerment. According to the department’s statement, all provincial role-players would be required to work as one family to foster unity among women. “This initiative is aligned to the women development mandate of creating an environment to help women develop constructive, affirmative and sustainable relationships while concurrently providing opportunities for them to build their competencies and needed skills to engage as partners in their own development and that of their families and communities,” the statement said. The dialogue is expected to help women reveal their purpose in life by being leaders and guide them into a growing relationship that everyone in the province can be proud of. It would also enlighten young women to quickly identify red flags in their intimate relationships in order to curtail incidents of gender-based violence and femicide. Daily News
