CAPE TOWN - Houses, livestock and farmland were in jeopardy, the Cape Winelands District Municipality (CWDM) said, as its Fire Service responded to a fire in Klapmuts, along the N1, close to Stellenbosch on Tuesday afternoon. The fire raged while on the opposite side of the Peninsula, Fire and Rescue Service were battling a fire in Noordhoek, with helicopters assisting the firefighting efforts. The Winelands fire, which started close to the train station, moved rapidly, jumping the N1 onto the Paarl side. The portion of the N1 was temporarily closed due to smoke and traffic authorities guided commuters regarding alternative routes. “At this stage houses, livestock and farmland are in jeopardy, teams are working to protect lives and property. Aerial resources, ground teams, equipment and personnel from CWDM, FPA and the Stellenbosch and Drakenstein municipalities are on scene. “CWDM requests that commuters please not attempt to drive through the very dense smoke and co-operate with traffic and fire officials,” the municipality said. City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said that they received the call about reeds in the wetlands of Noordhoek that had caught fire about 2.19pm. “Currently, 70 firefighters and 14 firefighting appliances are on scene. Helicopters have been requested to water bomb the area. “The scene is ongoing. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown,” he said. This is a developing story. Cape Times
