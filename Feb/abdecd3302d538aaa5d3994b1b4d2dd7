AFTER a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19, runners will again lace-up to take part in the Two Oceans Marathon which returns with a new name and sponsorship deal. The event will now be known as the Totalsports Two Oceans Marathon after the sports apparel retailer entered into a three-year title sponsorship agreement.  The two-day event will take place on April 16 and 17.   Race director Debra Barnes said  they were excited the marathon was taking place again. “We are excited to be staging our world-class event in partnership with Totalsports, a leading retail sports apparel brand. The commitment to enhancing the runner experience underpins much of who we are as an organisation, and when it comes to doing more for the runner, we could not have asked for a better alignment than with a brand that is as runner-centric as we are.”  Stein added: “We are committed to making running accessible to all South Africans, no matter the goal, distance, or motivation for running. “We want to inspire runners to live their best lives and we know many runners dream of completing the Two Oceans Marathon. “As the leaders in running footwear and apparel we share these values and look forward to supporting the Two Oceans Marathon to come back stronger than ever.”  The race’s chairperson William Swartbooi said: “In building this organisation we trust those who add value. We value those whom we trust. We are confident that this partnership represents a value-add on several fronts but most importantly for our key constituents, our runners”. President of Athletics South Africa James Moloi also welcomed the new partnership. “This welcome sponsorship will continue the tradition of offering career development for athletes, coaches and teams,” he said. “I take this opportunity to congratulate the race organisers on the new sponsorship and trust that it is a beginning of a long relationship between the two parties.”
