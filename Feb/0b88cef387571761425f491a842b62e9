CAPE TOWN - SCHOOL drop-outs and pupils who are struggling to complete their matric in Parkwood have been given an opportunity to shine. People between the ages of 18 and 27 with a Grade 9 certificate can register for a course with Atvance Academy for free. The academy in the area offers business administration services (NQF3) and contact centre support (NQF2) courses, and the programme is funded by a private company. The registration began on Tuesday and the classes will begin once  250 students have registered for the courses. So far more than 20 students have registered and community activists are encouraging people to sign up, and have put up posters and handed out flyers.  The administrator of the academy in Cape Town, Robertha Leroux, said they want to impart skills to youngsters in the area so that they can have a better future. “We want to go to every community where there are drug-related issues and gangsterism and we want to change the narrative in those communities and make sure that the youth have an opportunity to upskill themselves,” she said. A community activist and a founder of Parkwood Community Upliftment, Max Amansure, said: “This is a brilliant idea and it is long overdue, especially in this community of drugs, and we encourage the youth of this community to register because it is good for their development,” she said. The founder of the Cape Flats Stories, Stanley Jacobs, said the initiative was step in the right direction.
