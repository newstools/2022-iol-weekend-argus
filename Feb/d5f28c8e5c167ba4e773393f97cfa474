Cape Town’s stage legend Terry Fortune is taking a trip down memory lane in  honour of artists who have contributed to the industry. The event titled Terry Fortune’s Golden Oldies on the Lawn  is a concert and picnic hosted at the Baxter garden.  The event will pay tribute to performing artists and musicians over the age of 60. Having been in the industry for more than 50 years, Fortune said he’s been thinking about an event of this kind for many years. “What struck me is that many artists who enjoyed wonderful careers over the years, are forgotten and they seem to fade into oblivion once they reach 60 or so.” He added: “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic over the last two years made it almost impossible for artists to survive and, none more so than many senior artists.” “With this concert, we hope to give back the dignity of these legends.” In March, Fortune was honoured with the kykNET Fiëstas Legend award for his outstanding performances and immense contribution to the music industry. Fortune decided to host the event to celebrate and honour local artists and musicians for their contribution to the arts and its communities. “Many of them have never had their contributions recognised and this event seeks to provide that platform.” The line-up on the day includes an array of singers and musicians aged 61 to 85. The concert will be directed by Loukmaan Adams and is being made possible by the Western Cape Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport. Tickets for the event are available on Webtickets for R150 per ticket. The concert will be on Saturday, February 26 at 5pm.
