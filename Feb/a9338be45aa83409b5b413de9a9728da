Cape Town - The Patriotic Alliance (PA) leadership thought they were receiving a love letter when Loyiso Nkohla’s email dropped on Valentine’s Day, but they were in for a surprise. The well-travelled politician and activist was resigning from the party just five months after joining them. Nkohla said he was also leaving politics to focus on activism full time. He failed in his bid to become a PA councillor in four wards during the 2021 local government elections. “I have taken a personal decision not to continue being active politically under the banner of (the) Patriotic Alliance or any other political organisation for my personal development and my community at large,” he said in a statement. “This decision comes at a time when I am demanded by communities throughout many areas, from disadvantaged communities, particularly the informal settlements, backyard dwellers and social housing community, which continue to face illegal evictions and unlawful arrest and victimisation by some individuals who work for security agencies.” Nkohla is also a former ANC councillor. He was also the founding member of the Land Party and had a brief stint with the DA after then-mayor Patricia De Lille gave him a job in her office. He will forever be remembered for the 2013 protest where he gained himself the name “poo thrower.” He led a protest with Andile Lili through Seskhona People’s Movement. The group showed its disgust at the city's lack of proper toilets for many areas by dumping faeces at the Cape Town International Airport in June 2013, leading to Nkohla being known as the poo thrower. PA deputy president Kenny Kunene wished Nkohla well and said they have no issues over his resignation. “People join political parties, and at some point, leave. Three people may leave the party, and 300 join. He stated his reasons, and we wish him all the best in the role that he wants to play in the community.” Weekend Argus
