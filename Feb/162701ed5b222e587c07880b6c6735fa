CAPE TOWN - Judgment has been reserved in the legal battle between residents of Singabalapha  (We Belong Here) informal settlement in Observatory and the City of Cape Town. Singabalapha residents occupied an abandoned home for the aged called Arcadia Place in 2019, but they were evicted on October 2 of that year. They then moved to a grassy area in front of the vacant building, living in tents and other informal structures. After months of living on the pavement, the City made various attempts to remove the residents, also issuing them fines for contravening by-laws. The residents then approached the court and in 2020 were granted an interdict which blocks the City from evicting them, confiscating their property, harassing or abusing the community. The City has sought to appeal the interdict. The appeal was heard by a full bench of high court judges, including Judge Patricia Goliath, Judge Kate Savage and Judge James Lekhuleni. The City argued that they would not evict people using the by-laws. “The City repeatedly reiterated to the respondents and the various attorneys representing them that it does not evict people s from their homes by means of the by-laws. In this regard, the City had also given an undertaking,” the City argued. The residents Singabalapha argued that all the grounds for the interdict were met. “The Singabalapha residents’ occupation of the informal settlement was under persistent and repeated attack by the appellant, without any factual or legal basis to support their reliance on the streets by-Law,” their lawyers said.
