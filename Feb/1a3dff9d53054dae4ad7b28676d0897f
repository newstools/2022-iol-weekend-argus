Cape Town - Eight suspects are appearing in court after they allegedly allowed learner drivers to pass their tests fraudulently after failing their driving exams. According to court papers, Noloyiso Tose, Thabo Magobo, Sandile Archibald Johnson, Ingrid Wagenaar, Ivan Human, Warren Coetzee, Yolani Stalmeester, Phumezo Sovasi, Samuel Van Hansen, Xolile Gaja and the Khwesta Driving School are charged with fraud and corruption. The State is set to prove that members of the driving school had made arrangements with law enforcement officers to change appointments for tests in exchange for cash, and that those who had failed their exams would be issued with licences indicating that they had passed. The matter is currently on the roll at the Oudtshoorn Magistrate’s Court. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the group had applied for bail and the accused are currently in custody. “They are charged with fraud and corruption. More charges are likely to be added as the investigation continues. “The charges relate to licences - that of learners and drivers - and fraud. “It is alleged that members of a specific driving school had arrangements with law enforcement officials to expedite appointments for tests to be taken in exchange for money.  “They would also help candidates who failed said tests/exams to be issued with licences. Their case has been postponed to Friday for bail information and a possible bail application. Weekend Argus
