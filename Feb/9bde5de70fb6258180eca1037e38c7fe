CAPE TOWN – The murder case against alleged hitman Sizwe Bebula, accused of the murder of Grabouw school principal Zanele Mfubesi, has been transferred to the Strand Regional Court. Bebula, 40, made his last appearance in the Grabouw Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the case against Bebula was postponed until May 25, when he will be expected to appear in Strand. Mfubesi’s brother, Loyiso Mfubesi, said he was aware of the changes because the family requested the transfer. “As the family we deliberated on that matter and wrote to the NPA requesting for the case to be moved to the regional court.  “We were not comfortable with it continuing in Grabouw and besides we all stay this side in Cape Town.” Bebula was arrested in Vredendal early last year after Mfubesi, the principal of Umyezo Wama Apile High School in Grabouw, was shot dead in a hail of bullets in September 2020. She was driving on the N2 highway in the Overberg area. Investigations allegedly show Bebula was linked to two other murders in the Eastern Cape. Cape Times
