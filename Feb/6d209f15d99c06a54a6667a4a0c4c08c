TWO PEOPLE lost their lives and a third was injured when the SUV they were in rolled down an embankment before coming to a rest on train tracks on the N2 near the M25 KwaMashu off-ramp in Durban on Sunday. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the accident occurred at just after 6.30am on Sunday morning. Herbst said reports indicated that the driver of the SUV lost control which resulted in the vehicle crashing through the safety barriers. He said the vehicle rolled down an embankment about 15 metres and it came to rest on railway tracks below. “When medics arrived on scene, they found that the occupants had been thrown from the vehicle. “On assessment, medics found that an adult male and adult female had sustained fatal injuries and were declared deceased on the scene,” said Herbst. Herbst said there was a third patient, an adult male, who had sustained moderate to serious injuries. “The third patient… was treated on scene before being taken by ambulance to hospital,” he said.
