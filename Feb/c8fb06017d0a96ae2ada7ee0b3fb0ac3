Although definitely not the first time an unfortunate naval firing incident has happened over the years, it would seem that we, like many of our readers, were the recipients of fake news doing the rounds over the weekend. The news desk received calls from Simon’s Town residents who raised concerns about a navy exercise that they believed had gone wrong in the naval dockyard on Friday. Our reporter immediately made phone calls to try to verify the information. This included emergency services and the navy. An email was sent to the Navy’s media office, phone calls were made and WhatsApp messages were sent. But we received no response. We continued to pursue the story, as we are duty-bound to seek the truth and provide a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues. Our reporter received information from a highly placed source in emergency services, that a contact in the navy had said that an incident had taken place but they were handling it “in-house”. Unfortunately, fake news has become a pervasive pandemic in today’s world and the story also contained uncorroborated information from a local crime WhatsApp group. Whilst we try to remain vigilant against rumours at all times, we unwittingly carried unverified information in this instance. We therefore unreservedly apologise to our loyal readers and the South African Navy for an error in judgment in our story. To err is human, to forgive is divine, so we hope you will forgive us. We shall endeavour not to let you down again. Of course, our honest mistake could not go without comment by our detractors, who have taken the golden opportunity to wheel out their big guns to fire a few salvos at us. Perhaps they too should remember the adage: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,” as they have themselves been the victims of fake news fiascos in the past.
