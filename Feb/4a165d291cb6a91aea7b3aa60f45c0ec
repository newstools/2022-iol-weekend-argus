It is accompanied by 100km/h winds, alternating with gusts of 140km/h. It is moving south-west at 31km/h. “Emnati will cross the Anosy region and then come out to sea near the Androy region at the end of the afternoon,” Météo Madagascar said. It said alert levels indicated that Atsimo Atsinanana, Ihorombe, Anosy, Androy, Benenitra, Betioky and Ampanihy were in imminent danger. The cyclone also posed a threat to Beroroha, Ankazoabo, Sakaraha, Morombe and Toliara I-II.

Late on Tuesday afternoon, Météo-France said the cyclone was about to make landfall on the east coast of Madagascar just south of Mananjary, not far from the impact zone of cyclone Batsirai on February 5.  The World Meteorological Organisation said cyclone Emnati was forecast to make landfall in Madagascar at category 2 strength around 6pm. It said it was the fourth cyclone in a month to hit Madagascar and followed nearly the same track as Batsirai which caused devastation and loss of life on February 5. Daily News
