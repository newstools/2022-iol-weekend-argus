CAPE TOWN - The Swellendam municipality says its water situation is “dire” and has implemented water restrictions and a penalty water tariff with immediate effect. In a statement, the municipality said the water network has been under immense pressure for the last seven days and as of February 10, reservoirs in Swellendam including Bethelskop and Bakenskop, and Railton have still not reached satisfactory levels at over 70% of the reservoir’s capacity, despite water purification processes operating at maximum capacity. “The municipality simply cannot purify water at the rate at which it is being consumed and utilised. Residents are advised the municipality does however have sufficient raw water in the supply dams and sufficient capacity at the water treatment works. “Should the municipality not implement rehabilitative measures, the situation would require drastic action in the form of a system shutdown, which would mean no water supply to the network for at least 48 to 72 hours. An action the municipality is trying to avoid as this too has consequences for the network and is far more costly as it will require manual delivery of water with far greater inconvenience,” the municipality said. Following consultation with mayor Francois du Rand, a decision to implement level 3 water restrictions was made to be implemented as of midnight February 11 until further notice. “Level 3 water restrictions will only apply to Swellendam main town and Railton at this stage,” the municipality said. Additionally, level 3 water tariff penalties will also be applicable. Currently residential consumption makes up 72% of the total municipal water consumption, and therefore water restrictions have been targeted specifically at those consuming above 15kl per month. “The municipality sincerely requests Swellendam main town and Railton residents’ co-operation at this time as the situation is dire.” Cape Times
