CAPE TOWN - Two Cape Town police officers are expected in court for corruption on Thursday after allegedly taking money from a couple caught getting romantic atop Table Mountain. Western Cape police spokesperson Siyabonga Dyantyi said the officers were arrested on Wednesday. The arrests followed a police investigation into the incident on December 14. “On February 16, 2022, members of the Anti-Corruption Unit arrested two police sergeants stationed at Cape Town Central police station on corruption charges. “It is alleged that the suspects approached a couple on Table Mountain Road romancing in their vehicle. The couple was accused of public indecency and was made to pay an amount to avoid arrest. “The arrests followed an investigation after the incident occurred on December 14, 2021,” Dyantyi said. The suspects are due to make their court appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Separately, efforts to disarm suspects who contribute to serious and violent crimes in Western Cape communities yielded positive results when Ocean View police members arrested an 18-year-old for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition on Tuesday at about 1am. “The members were busy with patrols to combat gang-related shootings in the area when they noticed a group of males standing on the corner. When they saw the police vehicle approaching, one of the males started to run and the members gave chase. The suspect was apprehended and found in possession of a 9mm pistol and ammunition,” police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said. The suspect is due to appear in the Simon’s Town Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Cape Times
