DURBAN - A Bellair family are picking up the pieces after a fire swept through their home, killing three pet dogs on Thursday. Tenant Beverley Wood said she heard what sounded like a gunshot but did not pay attention to it because the sound was common in the area. A few minutes later other tenants notified her that the main building where her landlord lived was on fire. Wood said that the house was soon engulfed in flames. She said the landlord and a man tried to get the dogs out of the house, but the fire was intense and they struggled to breathe. A female pit bull and her two pups died in the fire. Tony Ridsdale and two others lived in the home. He could not be reached for comment. Wood said that the Bellair community was helping Ridsdale with a tent and food in the interim Ridsdale has been living in the home for 37 years. One person was treated for minor injuries and smoke inhalation, said Garrith Jamieson from ALS Paramedics. They and the Durban Fire Department arrived on the scene to find the house in Blairmont Avenue well alight. “The Durban Fire Department battled the blaze for over an hour while ALS Paramedics treated one patient, a male in his fifties, for minor injuries and smoke inhalation. “The fire is under control and the department is dampening down,” said Jamieson. He said that the cause of the fire was unknown. Daily News
