CAPE TOWN - Eastern Cape police have arrested an 18-year-old in connection with the murders of two family members this week. Police spokesperson Ursula Roelofse said Mount Fletcher detectives arrested the suspect just hours after the alleged murders on Wednesday. Mount Fletcher SAPS responded to a call about the bodies of two women found at a house at Jojweni just after 2pm. “It is alleged that the complainant found them after he left for town at about 6am earlier that morning on his arrival back from town,” Roelofse said. “The deceased Sandiswa Dasheka, 19, was the complainant’s niece. She was lying in front of the door in a pool of blood with multiple wounds on her body. “The second victim, Nomaza Mevani was lying behind the house also in a pool of blood with multiple wounds on her upper body. She was the wife of the complainant and stepmother of the suspect,” Roelofse said. It was also determined that the cell phones belonging to both women were stolen. “After an intensive investigation by the detectives, the 18-year-old teenager was arrested and stolen items were found in his possession as well as other exhibits.” “Acting District Commissioner Rudolph Adolph commended the detectives on the swift reaction and successful arrest of the suspect,” Roelofse added. The investigation continues. Cape Times
