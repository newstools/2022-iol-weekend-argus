Cape Town: An infant was allegedly thrown out of a moving car opposite the Deeds office in Plein Street this morning. The car sped off. People heading to work saw the tiny body lying in the street. The shocking incident left many traumatised and questioning who could be so heartless. “It had nappies on,” said witness Bonga Martin. “The baby was wrapped in a black plastic bag. I have never seen such cruelty in my life.” Martin said he did not want to jump to conclusions about what happened.  “Everyone around me was asking why would a person come to dump the baby in the CBD out of all the places. Someone asked if the vehicle was not stolen. I hope the police get to the bottom of this.” There is hope that the vehicle was caught by the CCTV cameras in the street and that the person behind the cruelty will be arrested. The incident happens as many groups are preparing to march to Parliament before the Budget speech today, Wednesday, February 23. Police spokesperson Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed that a passer-by found the body of a newborn baby in Plein Street this morning at about 9am. “Concealment of the birth case was registered for investigation. The investigation into the matter continues. Anyone with any information about this incident can contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” Twigg said. Weekend Argus
