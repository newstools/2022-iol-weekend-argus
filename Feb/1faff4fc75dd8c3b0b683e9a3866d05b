Cape Town – The State has asked for a month to formulate the final charge sheet of the trial of the Bonteheuwel mother arrested by the FBI and US Homeland Security for allegedly selling naked pictures of her 4-year-old daughter on the dark web. The 32-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, made her first appearance at the Parow Regional Court this morning. The case was previously heard at the Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court after her arrest last year in March. She is facing charges of manufacturing of child pornography, possession of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and financial gain from child pornography and rape. The State will now present their final formulation of charges for trial, known as an indictment. The matter was postponed to March 1, a month granted to present the charges. The woman's five children have been placed in the care of family members. The investigation was led by an agent from Homeland Security who pretended to be a buyer and traced her to Bonteheuwel after she allegedly received payments via PayPal. The community was unhappy about the postponement. Ward councillor Angus Mckenzie said justice which was being delayed. “Her court appearance was quick as her case was once again postponed, this time to March 1 to allow the State to formulate the final charge,” he said. “This is an absolute travesty of justice. “Justice delayed is justice denied. “These delays and inability of investigating officers to formulate charges sends out completely the incorrect message to those considering or attempting to harm our women and children. “For the sake of the victim, a young child, and for all victims of GBV, I am desperately imploring the justice system to act! “As a country we will never stop the scourge of GBV as long as the very laws meant to protect us from it, the custodians thereof are failing to implement.” Weekend Argus
