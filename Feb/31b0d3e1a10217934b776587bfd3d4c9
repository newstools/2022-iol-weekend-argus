Cape Town: Police are investigating yet another murder after the body of a woman was found with stab wounds in Kossovo informal settlement this morning.  Her body was dumped between the shacks.  It is suspected that the woman was attacked by someone she was romantically involved with. “Samora Machel police responded to a complaint this morning, at around 08:00, and drove to Kossovo informal settlement,” said police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi “Upon arrival at the camp, they found the body of an unknown female between the shacks, who sustained stab wounds to her body. The 32-year-old victim was declared deceased on the scene by the medical personnel. The motive for the attack is unknown.” He said the suspect/s fled the scene and had not been arrested. Just days earlier, a Gugulethu grandmother, 86, was murdered, her body entangled in a shirt. One of her eyes were gouged out. A 48-year-old man was arrested in connection with her murder. Last week, nine women were murdered in Cape Town.  Siya Monakali, of Ilitha Labantu, an organisation dedicated to fighting for the rights of children and women, said they were concerned that yet another woman has been murdered in the Western Cape.  “Not a week goes by without hearing of the murders of women in this province, and no real solutions have been brought forward from all stakeholders to effectively bring this injustice to an end.” He called on judges to send a strong message to perpetrators by imposing the harshest sentence on those found guilty of abusing and killing women.  “As Ilitha Labantu, we pledge to strengthen our efforts to work in partnership with police, civil society, government and communities alike to help break the silence of GBV plaguing our communities.” Police have urged anyone with information that might lead to the arrest of the perpetrator to call Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
