More than a hundred Cape Town motorists and motorcyclists drove in convoy along some of the city’s busiest roads on Saturday in support of Canadian truckers and their Convoy for Freedom protest. The local protest coincides with the Canadian one, which has been making headlines since late January. The protest convoy was started by individuals who say they are fed up with protocols and restrictions regarding Covid-19. Some of the protesters also said they did not agree with vaccine mandates. This comes after the Canadian government announced that all truck drivers, both American and Canadians, would need to be double jabbed to avoid a 14-day quarantine when crossing into Canada. The Canadian protests have since spread globally, drawing support from not only truck drivers, but also others who agree with the concept. According to Reuters, the Canadian protest has caused significant economic damage due to  its blockage of the Ambassador Bridge –  between Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario – which connects the two countries. Meanwhile, on the African side of the globe, South Africans also geared up in sympathy with the Canadian protests. A post on social media post called for drivers  to join a freedom convoy – which started at the Koeberg Interchange and travelled circular route via the M5, N2, R300 and the N1, ending back at the Koeberg Interchange – on Saturday, February 19. Kevin Jacobs, a spokesperson for Cape Town Traffic, said that Cape Town Traffic Services along with the South African Police Service  actively monitored the group of protesters. “The protesters drove in convoy on the City's freeways... along the M5, N2, R300 and the N1.” By 1pm the convoy had dispersed and the roads were back to normal.
