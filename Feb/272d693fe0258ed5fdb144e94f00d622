DURBAN – The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) announced on Tuesday that 188 operations were dealt with by its rescue bases between December 13, 2021, and January 9, 2022. NSRI said nine of these incidents involved animals, while 31 human lives were saved, and eight medical evacuations were carried out from vessels. The NSRI pink rescue buoy was also used in some operations. NSRI Rocky Bay commended a pink rescue buoy guardian who used a buoy to help a mother and child caught in a rip current. When the NSRI Ballito team responded to a drowning in progress, they found that the casualty was rescued by a member of the public with the help of a pink rescue buoy. The organisation said two turtles were assisted by the NSRI’s teams. “NSRI Port Edward rescued a turtle and handed it over to Animal Rescue, while a green turtle was found in a very weak state and taken by NSRI Agulhas to the Two Oceans Aquarium.” Other animal rescues included: The organisation said following reports of a person in difficulty, NSRI Strandfontein’s Satellite Station Monwabisi investigated, only to find it was just two seals in the water. “In Jeffreys Bay, the team investigated a possible shark attack only to find that it was a seal attacking a shark.”  This included securing vessels back to their moorings, righting capsized vessels, and towing stricken vessels back to shore. “In one incident attended to by the NSRI team at Port Alfred, a vessel capsized with four people on board. The vessel was righted and towed back to shore with the four injured crewmen on board, who were handed over to an awaiting ambulance,” said the organisation.
