DURBAN - More investigations will be conducted by uShaka Sea World into the injury suffered by a pink-backed pelican from Richards Bay, named Penelope.  Ann Kunz of uShaka Sea World said on Thursday afternoon, the uShaka Sea World Animal Health team admitted the pelican into their care. Kunz said even though it was not possible to determine whether the pelican was male or female, the team decided to call her Penelope. She said Penelope was seen early last week struggling to maintain her balance in the Richards Bay harbour. She was rescued by Wynand Strauss who took her to Dr Otto, a local Richards Bay veterinarian, who identified the injury to her left leg.  She remained in Dr Otto’s care for the following two days before being driven to Durban courtesy of resident, Shelly Prinsloo and the SPCA Richards Bay. “Initial examination on arrival at uShaka Sea World showed evidence that the injury to her leg was infected. She was weighed, given electrolytes and a few sardines which were infused with antibiotics, and left to rest. “We will continue to offer supportive therapy and conduct further investigations in the coming few days. We are looking forward to caring for Penelope and are hopeful that she will make a full recovery in the coming months,” Kunz said. uShaka Sea World veterinarian Dr Francois Lampen said: “Through my experience working at SANCCOB (Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds), saving sea birds, where I had the privilege of working with these charismatic birds, I discovered that pelicans are highly intelligent birds with strong characters.” Daily News
