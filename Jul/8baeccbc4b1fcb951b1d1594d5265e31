CALLING all art aficionados, if you’ve been looking for an opportunity to sustain and enhance your creative process, this fellowship might be a life-changing opportunity for you. The Zeitz MOCAA (Museum Of Contemporary Art Africa) and University of the Western Cape (UWC) fellowship programme, have extended their applications to Friday, July 22. The programme is supported by UWC’s Department of History and Centre for Humanities research. The Zeitz MOCAA'S senior staff will facilitate exposure to museum practice. The fellowship programme will begin in January next year and is open to any citizens in Africa. A total of five fellows will be selected to participate in the year-long programme. The programme includes the costs of tuition, accommodation, basic health insurance and a monthly stipend. Travel and visa costs to South Africa are not included. This fellowship is aimed at educating a new generation of African art and museum professionals. The programme will allow fellows to study and work with both institutions towards an accredited BA honours degree. This will consist of enrolling in a course of your choice from the available options and gaining work experience at the museum. Chief curator and executive director at the Zeitz MOCAA, Koyo Kouoh, said the museum is pleased to be partnering with UWC. “The partnership allows us to educate the next generation of exhibition makers and curatorial thinkers,” adding, “We remain committed to merging scholarship on contemporary art production and circulation from Africa and its diaspora. We hope to contribute to a new group of skilled professionals looking to work within galleries, art centres, art publishing and many more.” Associate professor at UWC’s history department, Rory Bester, said “We want to promote narratives that are important to building artistic and curatorial communities.”  Weekend Argus Keshia Africa
