IT’S all systems go for the 13th Klein Karoo Klassique festival to be hosted in Oudtshoorn.  This, the second annual arts festival to be hosted here hot on the heels of the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees (KKNK), is set to take place from August 5 to 9. Artistic director of the festival, Hugo Theart, said they were excited to welcome classical music enthusiasts from around the country. “Klassique is a celebration of classical music, but also a festival of food, art, tastings and wine experiences,” he said. “The programme is compiled to include a variety of works and instruments featuring the country’s top musicians and vocalists. “This year book discussions with award-winning authors are included.” Festival attendees can look forward to the music programme featuring acclaimed jazz and classical pianist, Charl du Plessis. Du Plessis will combine compositions from Chopin, Bach, Beethoven and many more for his recitals. In between the festival’s music offering, festivalgoers will be able to enjoy delicacies from the Klein Karoo. “They will be able to enjoy delicious food, wine, visual arts and book discussions. Nostalgie Restaurant is responsible for the menu, and Beans About Coffee will be responsible for coffee and other drinks,” Theart said. Writers who will be participating in the festival for the first time include Hertzog Prize winners Ingrid Winterbach and Johan Myburg, along with Oudtshoorn resident advocate Pieter van Wyk. A total of 12 classical music recitals will be presented throughout the festival. In addition to all this, members of the Cape Town Opera, artists from the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra and many more will be ready to dazzle the crowds over the five days. Tickets for the Klein Karoo Klassique can be purchased on Webtickets. Weekend Argus Keshia Africa
