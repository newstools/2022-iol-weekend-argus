Cape Town - Are you ready to step up? The World of Dance (WOD) South Africa Audition Series is currently underway across the country and those competing will be hoping to secure a spot at the World of Dance Nationals in Gauteng in December. The winners from nationals stand a chance to represent the country at the World of Dance Championships in the US next year. WOD SA will host its Cape Town regional audition qualifier at Hillsong Church in Century City today. Among those who will take part in the event is the Jodie Jackson Dance Centre All Stars from Retreat. The youngest member of the team, Isabella Newton, said this is an opportunity to compete with some great teams. “It means so much that I get to perform with my team at such an awesome event. It would be great to place with my dance family and qualify for nationals. “Dance is my way of expressing myself. I sometimes struggle to say in words what I am feeling. I'm also grateful to have received so many opportunities through dance,” she said. Founder Jodie Jackson said they have never entered the World of Dance Audition Series before. “There’s no set genre so there is no limit to what you can create, which gives us so much freedom. What we’ve created as choreographers with input from dancers is so special and meaningful to us. “We hope to bring the audience and judges on this journey with us, and in the process, make everyone feel our love for what we do. We are definitely hoping to qualify for nationals and we always hope for the best . You never know how each competition will go, however, sometimes it means so much more to even just be in it to begin with,” she said. Director for World of Dance South Africa, Quintus Jansen, said: “World of Dance South Africa created this platform to inspire our dance artists to develop to be the best that they can be. We also aim to take our home-grown talent to the world to show our skills, culture and passion on a global stage.” Weekend Argus
