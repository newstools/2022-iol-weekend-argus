Cape Town - Tickets for Joe Barber’s Family Reunion went on sale on Monday and sold out in a matter of hours. The reunion show dates were initially announced as November 7, 8, 11 and 12. But now show runners have decided to add two extra dates after tickets to the first four shows sold out in eight hours. Producer Ian Bredenkamp told Weekend Argus  that in the days leading up to ticket sales, the Ticketmaster page received 5 000 visits. “We are delighted to add these additional shows due to unpredictable demand,” he said. “The love for Joe Barber runs deep and we are delighted to give fans even more chances to enjoy Joe Barber’s Family Reunion on stage,” he said. Oscar Petersen and David Isaacs will bring the beloved characters Boeta Joe, Boeta Gamat, Washiela and Outjie back to the stage for their latest instalment. Since their first show, the pair said people have not stopped asking them when the next production will be.  “Even if we were not actively working on something, we still got asked this question. It hasn’t stopped for the last 23 years,” Isaacs said. “I love that there’s a sense of familiarity whenever people meet us,” Petersen added. The acclaimed actors said they never planned to go further than their first show in 1999. “Today, actors have so much knowledge of the industry. When we came onto stage the first time at the Artscape, it was a new world,” Isaacs said. Petersen added: “We stepped into a democratic theatre world where nothing catered to us. We were entrepreneurs in the industry.” Weekend Argus Keshia Africa
