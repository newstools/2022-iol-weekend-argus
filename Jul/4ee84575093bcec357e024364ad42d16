A Cape Town animal welfare organisation is looking to upgrade its security after a string of break-ins at its Ottery facility. The Animal Rescue Organisation (ARO) said despite their efforts to tighten security, four robberies over the last three weeks have left staff shaken.  The organisation beefed up security after six armed men, pretending to be clients, entered the facility and ran off with computers, cellphones and the personal belongings of staff members in January last year.  Spokesperson for the organisation, Lindsey Concer, said with the support of the clients and sponsors, they were able to implement multiple security upgrades shortly after last year’s incident, but this has not deterred criminals.  “ARO has been the victim of four break-ins in the last three weeks. Not much has been stolen, but the bills for continuously replacing and upgrading security measures are piling up,” she said. Concer said another concern was the safety of their staff. “During one of the break-ins the thieves were trying to get away with our generator only to be interrupted by a staff member arriving to work. They immediately ran away, but our concern remains,” she said. Police could not be reached for comment by time of publication. The organisation said it has recently upgraded a cottage on its property so that two staff members could stay there in order to care for the animals after hours, over weekends and on public holidays. The organisation has, in light of the increasing threats of crime, asked for donations to be able to secure the cottage with an alarm system to ensure that staff members feel safe.
