Cape Town - Two young South African scientists have blown away the judges of an international science festival held in Tunisia. Ethan de Wet and Kutlwano Tshatiwa have won medals at the International Festival of Engineering Science and Technology (I-FEST 2), for their impressive research. The pair were chosen to represent South Africa at the Eskom Expo International Science Fair. The I-FEST 2 was held from June 24 to 30. Tshatiwa, 17, had one of the top 10 projects at the festival and was awarded a gold medal. The matric learner from the North West province displayed his knowledge and experience of machine learning. Tshatiwa said winning a gold medal was a great personal achievement. “It was an indication that my research project is not only among the best at home but also on the international stage,” he said. “With other countries presenting smart and complex research, the competition was tough but I felt humbled by the experience and proud to represent my country.” De Wet, 18, was awarded a silver medal for his in-depth research which covered the physics of sound. The Curro Durbanville student’s project was selected for international participation for its ability to prove how an industry dependent on natural resources can become eco-friendly. De Wet said winning showed that all his achievements have come from hard work and dedication. “It is great to reap the benefits of all the hours I’ve put in. This achievement is a wonderful representation of the bright minds within our country,” he said. Eskom group executive for government and regulatory affairs Nthato Minyuku said it is impressive to see how young people have developed award-winning research projects while still at school. “This assures us that our future is in good hands. They are a shining example,” she said. “I am confident they will share their brilliant ideas with their peers, and encourage them to follow their lead.”  Weekend Argus Keshia Africa
