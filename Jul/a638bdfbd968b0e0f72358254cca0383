Cape Town - Their aim is to give back, make a change in the world and to put a smile on the faces of others. In celebration of Mandela Day, Girl Guides Cape West will be doing a toy drive and distributing them to various organisations like orphanages, early childhood development (ECD) centres and shelters across the city. Hannah Gardener, a teddie for Girl Guides Cape West, said: “Giving toys to children who don't have them is kind.Toys make children happy. Mandela wanted us to be kind and everyone must love each other. I want to give my old toys to children to make them happy.” Fellow member, Jamie Prinsloo, said: “I have outgrown all my toys and even though I still treasure them, I'm so happy to be able to donate them to kids who will love and appreciate them. “Mandela was someone I admire and to be able to honour him by doing good deeds like feeding the poor, or donating toys to the underprivileged is wonderful,” she said. Mother to Jamie and communications and marketing chairperson for the movement, Tanya, said putting a smile on the faces of children means everything. “So many children have nothing. Nothing to call their own. So many of us have toys that are no longer being used or are old or our kids simply get bored of them and don't play with them any longer.  “This ‘old’ toy can bring so much happiness to a child. So instead of dumping these toys, we will clean them and give them new life and present them to a child or playgroup who will love them. “We are incredibly proud of how our members as well as the public always support our projects and we hope they will do the same again this year,” she said.
