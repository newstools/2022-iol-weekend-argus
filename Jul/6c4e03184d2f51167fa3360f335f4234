More than 70% of motorists nabbed for various road offences across the Western Cape roads were arrested for drunk driving.  The Department of Mobility’s weekly statistics showed that 73 of the 98 people arrested on the roads were for driving under the influence of alcohol and the remaining were for speeding to fraudulent documents The provincial traffic services implemented 214 integrated roadblocks, vehicle checkpoints and speed control operations from July 4 to 10 where 29 660 vehicles were stopped and checked. Over that same period, 22 car crashes were reported, in which 24 people were killed. MEC of Mobility Daylin Mitchell said the figures highlight how drunk drivers continue to be a risk to road safety in the Western Cape. Mitchell said alcohol and roads do not mix, and people should not drink and drive or drink and walk. “Even small amounts of alcohol can affect your judgement as a road user.  “If you are convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, you will have a criminal record,” he said. “You could take your own life and/or another person.” Last week, 229 speeding offences were recorded and 6 525 fines were issued.  The nature of the fines varied from traffic violations to driver or vehicle fitness. Another 45 vehicles were impounded and 42 vehicles were discontinued for not being road worthy.  Mitchell said speeding was a serious concern as the faster one drives, the less time a driver had to respond to an emergency or stop to avoid a crash. “Speeding is irresponsible and dangerous.  “The highest speed limit that was exceeded last week was 165km/h in a 120km/h zone,” he added.
