Cape Town – As part of Mandela Day celebrations, the Animal Welfare Society of South Africa (AWS SA) launched a one-of-a-kind walk-through vaccination clinic and offered the first 67 pets free vaccinations as a way of promoting the veterinary health care facility. Nicole Williams, who brought her poodle and pit bull for vaccinations, said this was a great initiative by AWS SA. She said pet owners needed to be made aware of the importance of vaccination.  “When vaccinating your pets, veterinarians can check if animals are healthy and also bring other issues to light that owners may miss,” she added. “Being an animal lover and Mandela baby (birthday today), it is important to take time out and reflect on what organisations like this do on a daily basis to make society a better place for our pets,” she added. Thereza Wiese, who brought her poodle in for a vaccination, said: “This is a fantastic idea by the Animal Welfare Society of South Africa.” AWS SA spokesperson Allan Perrins said Mandela Day was a reminder that people had the ability and responsibility to change the world for the better. “The Animal Welfare Society of South Africa has been a major force for good for the past nine decades and Mandela Day presents us with an opportunity to showcase our work and garner additional support. Our expectations have been exceeded,” he said. His message to pet lovers: “Take good care of your pets. Ensure that their vaccinations are up to date at all times. If you are considering getting a pet then please consider adoption.” Weekend Argus
