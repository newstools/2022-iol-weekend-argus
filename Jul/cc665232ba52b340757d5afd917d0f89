KNOWN for its world-class mountain biking, running and hiking trails, MTO Trails has expanded its offering to include a range of accommodations across South Africa. MTO Trails, which forms part of the MTO Forestry Group, has newly renovated self-catering cottages in their MTO Jonkershoek plantation, near Stellenbosch. The renovation is in line with the MTO Group’s aim to build an environmentally conscious ecotourism portfolio. The Jonkershoek Valley Cottage comes with a wash bay and secure shed for overnight guests who bring their bikes on the trip. With the Jonkershoek Mountains as a backdrop, the cottage can sleep six people, in three bedrooms. Each room comes with a set of twin beds. The cottage has an open-plan kitchen and dining room accompanied by a log fire for colder nights. An outdoor gas-fired braai area is provided to whip up your meals while surrounded by the serenity of nature. The grounds has a rich birdlife and wildlife, including Cape leopards, honey badgers, mongooses and baboons. They say that a change is as good as a holiday, but the only thing better than a holiday is a free one.
