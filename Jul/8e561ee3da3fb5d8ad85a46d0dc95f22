Cape Town - Pupils at Norman Henshilwood High School are excited to participate in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Schools Challenge next month. The competition will not only expose pupils to how the repurchase rate is set, but also aims to increase the level of economics as a subject and career. The event, hosted by the South African Reserve Bank and Department of Basic Education, will cover a range of things from analysing data to preparing a monetary policy statement, as the governor and his MPC team would do.  Kezia Jacobs, who will be competing in the competition, said: “My team and I are extremely excited to have been given this opportunity. We are actively working towards giving  our best. We look forward to participating in the MPC Schools Challenge, as this would not only consist of a collaborative team effort, but an opportunity to pursue a career in the field of economics. “Economics is an essential, everyday part of life, and equips us to make the necessary informed decisions. It serves as a foundation for studying and comprehending the relationship between people and nations. “Economics has many real world applications and provides a meticulous and methodical way of thinking,” she said. Economics teacher at Norman Henshilwood High School,  Karen Poole said it is important for pupils to be involved in economic activities. “Pupils are able to apply theoretical knowledge to practical experiences in the different spheres in which economics focuses on. Pupils also get to see that they can be part of the solution of social ills in society. They are the leaders of the future who can bring about positive change, which they most probably don't realise when they are sitting in the classroom. “Pupils are able to provide solutions for the problems we are facing in South Africa as well as on a global stage. We are excited to participate in the MPC schools challenge,” she said. The winners will be announced on August 31. Weekend Argus
