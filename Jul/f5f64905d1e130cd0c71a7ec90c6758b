In just under a month, murder accused Daniel Smit has moved up by only six places on the waiting list at Valkenberg psychiatric hospital to undergo a mental health evaluation.  Smit, a former train driver and self-confessed occult member, stands accused of the murder of 13-year-old Jerobejin van Wyk, from Klawer. The 56-year-old briefly appeared in the Klawer Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on five charges relating to the teen’s murder in February.  The charges include murder, the attempted murder of Van Wyk’s friend, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice and failure to report an incident to the police. The pair were allegedly caught by the accused stealing fruit at the accused’s house.  Smit was previously referred to the psychiatric hospital for observation following a report from psychologist CWA van Zyl. At his previous appearance, Eric Ntabazalila, a spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, said they had been informed that Smit stood at number 93 on the waiting list. On Tuesday, Ntabazalila said the case against Smit had been postponed until August 16 for the accused to be accommodated at Valkenberg.  “He is currently number 87 on the waiting list,” said Ntabazalila.
