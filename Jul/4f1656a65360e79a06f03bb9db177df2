A Cape Town restaurant is hoping to clinch the title of South Africa’s favourite pizza.  Having come in second place at last year’s Porcupine Ridge Pizzeria Challenge last year, Ferdinando’s Pizza has its sights set on winning first prize this time around.  The competition, which runs from July 1 to September 30, aims to identify South Africa’s favourite pizzeria, through consumers who can cast their votes via QR codes in restaurants across the country.  Located on the lower main road of Observatory, Ferdinando’s is owned by a couple, Diego Milesi and Kimon Bisgono, who started the restaurant 10 years ago.  The pair met while Bisgono, a South African, was on an international trip and fell in love with an Italian, Milesi, and decided to relocate to Cape Town. What started as a ‘secret pizzeria’ in their home later moved to formal premises. “This year we celebrate ten years of making pizza. It has been a journey of love and passion,” said Bisgono. “We started in our apartment and now we have a 70-seater restaurant in Observatory. We are proud. It’s all about love and being true to who we are.”  Ferdinando’s Pizza is named after the couple's four-legged best friend. Coming in second place last year was a surreal experience for them, the couple said. “It was an amazing moment.  “We’ve been told many times we are the best, but to hear it from the mouths of the whole country was inspiring.” Milesi said. He added:  “We are going to keep going and doing what we love and do the best. We had a huge party last year for our team when we took the second spot.” Their tip for pizza lovers is simple: “Pizza must be eaten hot and fuss-free, in good company or alone. It must satisfy on all levels.” Weekend Argus Keshia Africa
