The Aurorah Kuilsriver Community Action Network (CAN) will launch a mini library in Sunbird Park to mark Nelson Mandela Day. The founder of the non-profit organisation, Latifah Jacobs, will be opening Aurorah Hotspot Library as part of her 67 minutes of service to others by promoting literacy among children. Jacobs, a recipient of the Play Your Part Award for outstanding citizenship earlier this year, said that Aurorah had grown from being a “feeding and awareness” scheme during Covid-19 to offering aftercare and youth programmes such as job readiness, anti-bullying and now reading and learning. “What better way to celebrate Mandela Day than by encouraging the one thing that is a key part of changing the narrative, creating a positive change through reading and creating a safe space to learn.” “Aurorah has transitioned to the next phase of reaching our goal to normalising access in the community we serve,” she said. Jacobs said even though there is already a library in Kuilsriver, it was not easily accessible by all and her organisation was focused on educating youth and children. “Some parents work from Monday until Friday and they do not have time for their children on weekends. They are busy with washing and other things,” she said. The library was inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Poet and publisher Haroldene Tshienda is also expected to join in on Monday to read a story to children and recite a poem. “We want to promote literacy among children and older people. With the storytelling (poems), I want to (light) a fire within them. The public library is far away and some people need to take a taxi when they go there, so this library will close that gap,” she said Jacobs has appealed to those who can to donate to her library at 27 Lovebird Walk, Sunbird Park, Kuilsriver.
