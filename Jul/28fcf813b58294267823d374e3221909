Cape Town - One of the three men arrested for the murder of Constable Zuko Sima, who was gunned down in Delft on Sunday, has been formally charged and made an appearance in court. Grant Jacobs, 31, made his first appearance at the Bellville Magistrate’s Court yesterday where he is facing charges of murder and hijacking and is expected back in court on July 12 for bail information. The Hawks said the two other suspects who were detained were released due to a lack of evidence. The arrests were made on Sunday shortly after the shooting. Sima was standing next to his car in Delius Street, Delft South, when he was shot in the head. Sima was stationed at Gugulethu police station and his VW Touran was taken from the scene. He was a father of one. Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani explained that the police were led to Elsies River where Sima’s vehicle was found. “One of the initial three suspects arrested for the murder of Constable Sima has been charged. This comes after their arrest on Sunday on allegations of murder and hijacking following an incident during the early hours of the same Sunday, which left an off-duty police constable stationed at Gugulethu with fatal gunshot wounds in Delft. “Investigation led to the discovery of the vehicle in Elsies River and the three were subsequently brought in for questioning. “This then led to the matter being referred to the Hawks in Bellville for further probing. “Through intensive investigation, the questioning of the suspects led to the release of two of them due to insufficient evidence.” On June 21, Constable Shamielah Arendse, 26 who was stationed at Table Bay Harbour police station, was gunned down outside her home in Gilo Street, Leiden, in Delft. Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said the case was in the hands of the Hawks. No arrests have been made. Weekend Argus
