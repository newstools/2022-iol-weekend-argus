Cape Town - The Western Cape senior majorettes team not only felt the beat but also blew away the judges with their slick skills on turf. They were crowned the winners in the provincial category at the recent Federation of Dance Drill, Cheerleading and Majorette Sport South Africa (FDDCMSA) national championships in Bloemfontein.  A member of the Western Cape team, Tracey- Leigh Jacobs, said she is proud of her teammates. “It was very competitive and fun competing against other teams and provinces. They all showed good sportsmanship and were very supportive. “What I enjoyed most about the competition was seeing different styles and meeting new people that share the same love for the sport as I do. I also enjoyed the amazing crowd and supporters cheering us on,” she said. Western Cape coach Chantal Lombard said it still felt unreal. “It was important for us to be focused on the task at hand and not allow any distractions to disrupt our aura and mentality as a team. We’ve worked way too hard to get to this point and not do well. “It was great that we could be ourselves, perform on a national platform and to prove a lot of negative competitors wrong. The competition was inviting, yet interesting at times,” she said. President of FDDCMSA Christine Pretorius said they were grateful to all the teams who competed at the inaugural competition. “For a new federation to have 38 teams from all over the country participating is an enormous achievement.  We are looking to grow the sport of majorettes and dance drill even more in the future. “We want to congratulate all the teams on their outstanding results and achievements and look forward to seeing them on the field again,” she said.
