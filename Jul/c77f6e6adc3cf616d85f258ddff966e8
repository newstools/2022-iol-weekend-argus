Cape Town - The trial against the Cape music maestro charged with the rape and sexual assault of a teenage boy has been delayed by five months.  The musician made a brief appearance at the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning after the matter was set down for plea and trial nearly six months ago. In April the case was again postponed to today for plea and trial. The court heard this date was moved to November 30.  Activists against abuse and sexual crimes are outraged, stating the victim’s life had been placed on hold while the accused was allowed to continue his lifestyle outside bars. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “He was released on bail of R1 000 (previously).” Activist Latifah Jacobs, who had been following the case and supporting the victim, said they were disappointed at the constant delays. “There is no consideration for the victim, he cannot go forward with any plans,” she said. “Once again the system has failed a survivor. They are giving the perpetrator a lifeline. The accused’s life has continued as normal.” The 48-year-old is alleged to have sexually attacked his 14-year-old victim in 2013. It is alleged these incidents continued until the age of 19. The accused may not be identified after an order was made by the court. In an affidavit submitted during his bail application, he stated he intended on pleading not guilty to the charge. The accused is well known in the music industry and has shared the stage with local music giants and international artists. Weekend Argus
