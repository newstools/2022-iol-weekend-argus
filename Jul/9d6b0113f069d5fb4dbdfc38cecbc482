The Community Police Forum (CPF) of Elsies River sent strong messages against the perpetrators and urged members of the public to play an active role in supporting the community safety organisations. “The killing of a 15 year old angers all of us. We as the Elsies River Community Police Forum strongly condemn this cruel act against the community, and the thugs who robbed us of such a young life. “Someone must know or have seen who pulled the trigger and must come forward. He said children needs to be able to play outside and the communities can no longer be held captive in their own homes and fearful of coming out. “Our children should feel free to play in the parks and enjoy a normal childhood, free from shootings and all sorts of lawlessness,” said Hamish Arries, chairperson of the Elsies River CPF.
