Cape Town - A fugitive who evaded the South African government and police has been placed behind bars after he handed himself over to authorities in the US following a successful extradition. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Ricardo Spagni is facing fraud charges relating to over R1 million. He is expected to make an appearance in the Cape Town Regional Court for further management of his case. Spagni fought to evade the police and authorities by launching various unsuccessful applications to the High Court of South Africa, after South Africa sought an extradition in the US. Ntabazalila said it has taken a year since his arrest in July last year to reach this point. “Spagni was arrested in the United States of America on July 21, 2021 pursuant to the request for provisional arrest. South Africa subsequently sought his extradition from the United States of America. “On the eve of his extradition hearing in the US scheduled for May 25, he waived his rights and agreed to cooperate with the authorities. “Arrangements between SAPS and the US Marshals are under way to have him brought back to South Africa to attend his criminal trial (inter alia fraud involving R1 453 561), which is partly-heard at Cape Town Regional Court,” Ntabazalila said.
