A security guard was shot and wound during a cash-in-transit heist in Grabouw on Monday afternoon. According to the police, the incident occurred after 3pm. Spokesperson for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in the Western Cape, Zinzi Hani,  confirmed that police are investigating the matter. The chairperson of the Grabouw Community Police Forum David Williams said while the details around the incident were not clear, they were concerned about the matter.  “We do not have the full details yet, but we condemn the behaviour. I do not remember an incident like this in our area before,” he said. Incidents of similar robberies have occurred in different parts of the province this year.  In January, four people, including two suspected robbers, were injured in a cash-in-transit heist along the N1 near Goodwood. In that same month, a Fidelity guard collecting money at the Unika Power Trade in De Doorns was approached by an armed suspect who grabbed the bag of money and fled the scene. A 26-year-old was arrested in June and charged with robbery.  A month later, police were called to a scene in Dunoon after a failed heist in the area after a cash van was attacked by a group of armed suspects as it was nearing an ATM at a shopping centre in the area.  In May, the Khayelitsha Regional Court convicted Siyanda Xawuka, 34, Dumisani Ngudle, 28, and Yongama Ndolombo, 34,  for a cash-in-transit heist that happened at a South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) pay-point in 2013.
