Cape Town - As the price of petrol increases, people are dusting off their saddles to travel across the city. The Animal Welfare Society of South Africa (AWS SA) has noticed an increase in the number of horse-drawn carts on the road. The spokesperson for AWS SA, Allan Perrins, said the assumption was based on personal observations and reports from members of the public. “Horse-drawn vehicles are quite a common sight in Cape Town. Many families owe their livelihoods to their ponies and horses. As long as the horses are well cared for, the cart is in a roadworthy condition, the harness fits properly, the driving is left to an adult and the cart and horse are registered, then we have no objection. “Before anyone decides to switch to a horse and cart we would encourage them to do their homework. Horses are expensive and high-maintenance animals. A car can be parked and forgotten about; the same does not apply to owning a horse or pony as they require year-round care,” he said. The spokesperson for the Cart Horse Protection Association, Marike Kotze, said: “We are seeing an influx of new, young drivers with very little regard for the rules. “The environment in which they live tends to leave very little room for the consideration of the welfare of anything or anyone beyond their immediate survival. With the number of registered working horses being limited, these youngsters are now starting to work with non-registered horses. “For those road users alongside carts, please remember that under the City of Cape Town’s by-laws, animal-drawn vehicles do in fact have right of way. Be patient when you see a horse on the road – remember they do not have anti-lock braking system (ABS) brakes and cannot stop as fast as your car can. “Please do not hoot at horses or make any loud noises. Horses are flight animals and can move sideways without any notice and land up in front of your car,” she said. Weekend Argus
