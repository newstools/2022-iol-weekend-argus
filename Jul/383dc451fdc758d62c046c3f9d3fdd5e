Cape Town -  Concerns have been raised by the Cape of Good Hope SPCA regarding people using animals to beg. This comes after they recently responded to a complaint about a beggar who used a dog to obtain money from motorists at the Racecourse Road off-ramp from the M5 highway in Kenilworth. It was reported that Pepper was carried like “a sack of potatoes” and looked sluggish. Chief inspector of the Cape of Good Hope SPCA, Jaco Pieterse, said it is sad that people exploit animals for their own gain. “I am pleased that our team was able to rescue the dog. She is now in safe hands and will not be subjected to any form of cruelty again. “Animals are an emotive subject and therefore the beggars know people will give them money. This is exploiting an animal. The animal did not ask to be here. We feel sorry for people that do not have an income; however, exploiting an animal is not the solution. “Please do not support people that make use of animals for begging. Rather donate to a worthy cause that works to get the homeless off of the street. By supporting these people you are merely supporting the trade of using animals for begging. This does not solve the problem, but creates a new problem,” he said. Jean Stubbs, who commented on the Cape of Good Hope SPCA’s Facebook post on this matter, said: “(This is) so awful. (It is) unacceptable to see animals subjected to abuse of any kind. While there is never an excuse, one needs to remember that often young children and even babies are used for the same reason.  “If a human can do that on their own, what chance does an animal have? Thank you SPCA once again for your dedication and care.” Weekend Argus
