Cape Town - Nearly two weeks after a gruesome aircraft accident in Lower Crossroads, another crash took place in Worcester on Saturday morning leaving two people injured. The accident occurred during the landing stage at the Worcester aerodrome. Two people who were on board the aircraft sustained injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment. Spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority Sisa Majola said two investigators from the accident and incident investigation division were dispatched to the scene to gather more information and have since started the process of collecting evidence. “The accident and incident investigation division has been informed of an aircraft accident on (Saturday) which occurred at 11am. The aircraft took off from Worcester aerodrome with the intention to land at the same aerodrome.” “There were two persons on board the aircraft and both occupants sustained injuries and were taken to hospital,” he said. Majola said a preliminary report will be issued within 30 days of the accident, and that a report is often compiled to promote aviation safety and reduce the risk of accidents in future. “In instances where an investigation takes longer than 12 months to complete, the investigation team is expected to issue an interim statement to indicate the progress made at that point in time,” Majola said. The accident took place 11 days after two occupants were injured when a light aircraft went down on the evening of June 28 in Lower Crossroads. Reports indicated that the victims were robbed of their belongings by people from the community. The accident came after a report by Weekend Argus that a light aircraft made an emergency landing on the R44 close to Winery Road in Stellenbosch leaving two passengers injured on June 1.
