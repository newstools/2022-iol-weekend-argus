Cape Town - It was a gloomy Mandela Day for teachers and children of Sithemebele Educare in Philippi after armed men stormed into the early childhood development (ECD) centre.  They then locked one teacher in the shower and held another at gunpoint, along with a parent and her child. The robbers fled the scene with valuables such as cellphones, the children’s food and a microwave. The teacher who was held at gunpoint said: “I am still very uncomfortable and do not want any visitors.” One of the social workers on the case, Tara Appalraju, confirmed that the victims were deeply traumatised, especially the teacher who had the gun held to her forehead. “We can confirm that the robbers entered the property and held the teacher at gunpoint. The teacher in her first session froze in response and couldn’t move. Our immediate concern is the safety and well-being of the affected victims.  “We must allow SAPS and the rest of the team to conclude their intervention. Trauma debriefing will be required with ongoing support,” she said. The South African Education Project (SAEP) initiated emergency protocols to support the victims. Head of communications and fund-raising at SAEP, Shane Everts, said the area is known for high crime rates. “These centres look after children who are already vulnerable and they need to know that they are safe,” he said. Police spokesperson Ndakhe Gwala said: “This office confirms that a business robbery case was registered for investigation at Philippi East police station on Monday. No arrest has been made yet, investigations continue.” Anyone with information on the business robbery is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111. Weekend Argus
