Cape Town - A 24-year-old woman who hid compressed dagga worth R10 000 inside small packages, which were being allegedly prepared to be sold, was caught red-handed by police inside a house in Hanover Park. The Police’s Essential Infrastructure Task Team Commander Lieutenant Colonel Louis Sontsonga and his team carried out the operation #Drugsoffourstreets when carrying out operations in Hanover Park yesterday. Philippi Police spokesperson Captain Lance Goliath said the team had begun their search at a house in Rywood Walk and struck gold when they found the young woman inside the premises. While searching the house, the police found compressed dagga hidden and wrapped in small packages, some in newspaper and a glass jar,  which were being prepared for a drug sale. The estimated street value of the dagga was R10 000. The young woman police said was often seen hanging out at known drug outlets in Hanover Park and was possibly being used to carry out drug runs. The woman is facing a charge of the illegal possession of drugs. Goliath explained: “Upon searching the house, members confiscated a large amount of compressed dagga and dagga that was prepped in small plastic bags ready to be sold. “The suspect will appear at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on a charge of the illegal possession of drugs.” Philippi Station Commander Colonel Adriaan Saulse said the woman’s arrest formed part of ongoing operations to remove drugs off the streets. “Police will continue clamping down on criminals and their criminal activities, thus creating a safe crime-free environment for everyone.” Weekend Argus
