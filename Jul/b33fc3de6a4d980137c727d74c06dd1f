City of Cape Town fire services responded to a fatal Westbank shack fire on Saturday  where they discovered the bodies of three children. Spokesperson for the fire services Jermaine Carelse said they had been called to the scene in Baxley Crescent shortly after 2am. He said several informal structures had been destroyed and two formal houses damaged. “When they arrived at the scene, firefighters found several structures burning. A total of 24 firefighters managed to contain and extinguish the blaze just before 4am. “During firefighting operations, the bodies of the children were discovered in one of the informal structures,” he said. The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed that the minors were declared deceased at the scene by medical personnel, and Mfuleni police had registered an inquest for investigation. “Upon arrival at the scene, fire and rescue extinguished the fire. After inspection, they discovered the charred bodies of three unknown minors, said Swartbooi. A community leader, Lorna Frieslaar, said the incident happened during load shedding, and that candles or excessive power might have been the cause of the fire. “It is sad because it is the lives of the young ones that were taken away. It happened during load shedding, and so it could be candles that caused the fire, or maybe the high voltage when the electricity came back on,” she said. The blaze happened after the Grabouw community experienced a fire on Friday evening. Theewaterskloof Municipality spokesperson Wilfred Johannes said damage assessments had been done in the area. “The rapid spread of the fire affected one bus from Gaffleys Transport, one private vehicle, three formal houses, and 66 informal structures,” he said.  “(On Saturday) morning, engineering crews were on site to assist the affected victims to clear the disaster scene.” Weekend Argus
