On Saturday afternoon, 10 of the city’s aspiring fashion designers   presented their latest designs at Khayelitsha Fashion Week. Dubbed the ‘Mother City Fashion Experience’, the event was created to showcase the skills and talents of aspiring fashion designers, photographers and models. The show has been running for six years and this will be its seventh year running. The show was created by breakfast show host at Zibonele FM, Bongani Matenjwa. Matenjwa said the production was organised with lights, a catwalk, performances, new designs and models. “The work of this event has been so successful. We’ve managed to secure partnerships that have made this possible,” he said. He added this was the year for new experiences as we took the event outside Khayelitsha to the historical Cape Town City Hall. The brands ZinClair, Simply Mooi, Clive M Couture, Saanda, Mananas Collection, Opulence by Kholosani, Size, Shafika, ApaChe and House of Chynee were featured at the show. Artist Afrosoul Athi, Mwezi, Soul child, Mphozisi Qalekiso and Banatha Daniels and KTC Fam entertained the guests. One of the featured designers, Moira Hurungo of formal wear brand Simply Mooi, said she’s honoured to be back at KFW. This year is her third time showcasing her designs at KFW. “KFW has become like family to me.  “This is a great platform for emerging designers.  “I’ve seen my career grow from strength to strength,” she said. Hurungo usually only creates formal wear outfits for women but decided to introduce menswear to her range for the show. Her theme for this range was based on her inner child’s desires. “Creating this was a healing process for me.  “I used colours and playful elements and put all those elements into my garments,” she said.
