Cape Town - An African folk musician from Greyton, in the Overberg region, is on a mission to honour his father Edmond Chitubura’s dying wishes. Edmond, who recently died of melanoma (sin cancer), had a goal to transform their family farm into a self-sustaining, safe and thriving environment to benefit his children and the rest of the community. To help keep his dream alive, Divine started a crowdfunding campaign through BackaBuddy. He described his father as a loving and caring person. “He was the kind of person who would stop to pick up every hiker along the road. My father and mother were both incredibly hard-working and faithful.  “They instilled much of their beautiful character in each of us as children. We are all responsible for the safety and security of each other. This is how my parents lived. “Growing up, they ‘unofficially’ adopted many children who had lost their parents. They (my parents) put them through school and we are all a family now. Giving is always a lesson to the one receiving, and they too become givers,” he said. “Having so many people supporting and donating is a true testament to the way my parents lived. All they gave to the world, we are now receiving that good from the world. Every supporter is making this dream come true,” he said. The farm is based in Divine’s home country, Zimbabwe. In a press statement, Grammy-award winner Jason Mraz said: “Your mission is noble and inspiring. I wish you luck and wellness on this journey. I hope I might come to visit you on this farm someday.” If you would like to support Divine, visit:  https://www.backabuddy.co.za/divine-mahara-chitubura.  Weekend Argus
