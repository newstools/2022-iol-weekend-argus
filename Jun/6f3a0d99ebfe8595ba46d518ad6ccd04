Cape Town - Ten schools in Cape Town had to abandon learning on Tuesday because teachers and pupils were unable to access the buildings as a result of flooding. ACJ Phakade Primary School in Nomzamo, Strand could not open its doors as the whole street leading to the school was flooded. Xolani Diniso, a councillor from an adjacent ward, said the street had always been a problematic even during light rain. “About three weeks ago the water and sanitation department was here to assess the situation and the challenge is there are people who built shacks on top of a pond. The only permanent solution to this problem is to relocate the people and open up the pond.” He added that he did not see learning and teaching happening on Wednesday  either. The City’s Disaster Management said during the last 24-hour measuring period, rainfall stations in the Cape Metropole recorded between 34mm and 123 mm of rain in a short period which had severely tested the capacity of the storm-water systems. Both formal and informal settlements were flooded despite the municipality saying they had a winter preparedness plan. WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the affected schools were situated in areas such as Phillipi, Macassar, Strand, Khayelitsha and Langa. “While some schools were inaccessible early this morning, ongoing rain throughout the day forced other schools to close early. “Examination or assessment timetables will be rescheduled to accommodate any disruption caused at the schools.” The heavy downpours were expected to continue until Wednesday. “At this stage there are no life threatening situations only damage to properties,” said Charlotte Powell from the City’s Disaster Management  Weekend Argus
