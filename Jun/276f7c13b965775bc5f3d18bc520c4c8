Samora Machel police are investigating two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder following a shooting in Bathandwa Mdingi Street on Wednesday evening.  According to reports, five men were leaving a place in Bathandwa Mdingi Street at around 7pm, when they were approached by three armed men who opened fire on them. A police spokesperson, Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi, said a 20-year-old man died at the scene and the other four victims, aged between 17 and 32, were taken to hospital. “We can confirm that a 27-year-old man has since been declared dead at the nearby hospital. The unknown suspects who fled the scene, are yet to be arrested,” he said. Cape Flats Safety Forum chairperson Abie Isaacs said the provincial government’s safety plan had failed the communities. “The crime should not be politicised. The safety plan to deploy the Law Enforcement Advancement Programme (Leap) officers has failed our communities. We need a multi-faceted approach that will include the non-profit organisations, CPF’s and other organisations,” he said. A local councillor, Bongani Maqungwana, expressed shock over the shooting. “The area has been quiet for the past two weeks and the CPF and SAPS management have been engaging communities in street imbizos in an effort to educate the (public) about strategies to prevent scenes of this nature,” he said. Police said the shooting might have been motivated by revenge. It took place three weeks after four people were murdered in Khayelitsha Site B when unknown men opened fire at a supermarket. The shooting in Khayelitsha happened two days after the Gugulethu mass shooting that left three dead and two injured. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Weekend Argus
