Durban - Political parties and anti-corruption organisations have welcomed and applauded the arrest of the Gupta brothers, Rajesh and Atul, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), saying it was a breakthrough for the South African justice system. The Department of Justice and Correctional Services confirmed on Monday that it had received information from law enforcement authorities in the UAE that the fugitives from justice have indeed been arrested. The SACP welcomed the arrest and said they must be extradited to South Africa as soon as possible to account for their alleged role in state capture corruption, which resulted in massive losses, pushing South Africa’s economic and broader social transformation back.  The arrest of the brothers came after the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) issued a red notice for them last year in connection with money laundering and fraud charges. The SACP said it looks forward to more arrests in connection with state capture corruption. “While the arrest of those who were complicit in the state capture corruption and the fugitives from justice is hopefully taking the Orange Overall Campaign in South Africa forward, as the SACP we want all the stolen funds, public resources and national wealth recovered, together with the damages incurred, through asset forfeiture.  “The South African state must also seize all the unjustified ill-gotten wealth or the assets acquired or accumulated from corrupt activities, irregular or illicit conduct. This must be intensified,” said the SACP’s Dr Alex Mashilo. The Active Citizens Movement (ACM) also welcomed the arrest. “We call on the NPA to act speedily in the extradition process and to ensure the Gupta brothers return to South Africa,” said ACM head of communications Yashica Padia. The ACM said the arrest has strengthened their resolve to continue to challenge and expose corruption at every turn.  THE MERCURY
