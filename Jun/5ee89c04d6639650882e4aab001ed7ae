THE embattled ANC Western Cape MPL Danville Smith has been released on R10 000 bail after he and two others were arrested for car theft.  Smith was among three suspects who appeared at the Vredendal Magistrates Court on Thursday on charges of theft of motor vehicles and fraud.  The trio were arrested on Tuesday after police were made aware of a series of car thefts over the past six months from owners who had been advertising the sale of their vehicles on social media.  “The registered owners of the vehicle were approached by a bogus buyer who made electronic payments and sent fraudulent bank notifications to the seller, that prompted the release of the vehicle with documentation,” said police spokesperson, Captain FC van Wyk.  “A successful integrated undercover operation was conducted, which also led to the seizure of a white BMW.” On Thursday, Smith’s lawyer André Johnston told Weekend Argus his client had been granted bail and the case was postponed to July 12. The ANC’s provincial spokesperson, Sifiso Mtsweni, said they were aware of Smith’s arrest.  “We will follow developments around the case closely and advice on the course of action going forward in line with our guidelines on members who are charged.” Smith’s fate in the party will be discussed next week Monday.  Last year, Smith stepped aside as the West Cost treasurer after he was charged with fraud and corruption in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. He remains an MPL representing the party in the Provincial Legislature.  Smith and his co-accused Peter Blackbenberg are accused of pocketing R25 000 for a bogus food parcel invoice for a Mandela Day event in 2016 in Lambert’s Bay. Weekend Argus.
