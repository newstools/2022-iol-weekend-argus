Cape Town - A Grade 4 girl is working hard to achieve her goals in gymnastics after receiving gold during the Western Cape District Trials. Fadwah Arendse, 10,  is a pupil at West End Primary school in Mitchells Plain and is now aspiring to achieve a place at the Western Cape Championships, which will be held in August. Fadwah started gymnastics at the Spine Road Gymnastics Club as an extra subject four years ago. But little did she and her family know that she had something special to offer. Fadwah’s coach, Adnaan Appies, recognised that she was talented. “Fadwah began gymnastics four years ago and due to Covid-19 they were unable to compete in competitions. “During one of her first competitions this year, she achieved gold. “When she started out, I told her parents that I had spotted talent and she has been flourishing ever since.” Fadwah’s mother, Soraya Arendse, 38, said she was very proud of her daughter. “She started doing the sport as an extra activity and there was no one in our family who did this kind of sport.” she said. “She showed a lot of interest in it and she became very good at it. During her first trials she received gold in her level. She practices twice a week and is very dedicated. Fadwah said she aspired to always do better. “I am very proud of myself and I am happy with the sport I am doing,” she said. Weekend Argus
