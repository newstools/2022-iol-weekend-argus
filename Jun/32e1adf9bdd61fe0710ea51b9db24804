KEAGAN MITCHELL Cape Town – Could we see the next Springbok come through the South Africa Rugby Craven Week? Many of those who are in the current South African squad for the upcoming international season came through this prestigious tournament. This includes three uncapped players from the DHL Stormers, lock Salmaan Moerat, loose forward Evan Roos and utility forward Deon Fourie. Devon Booysen from Ravensmead will be hoping to follow in their footsteps and will represent the WP XV Under-13 team at the country’s biggest schools rugby tournament. The Grade 7 pupil at Pinedene Primary School said it is a dream come true. “I am so excited for the competition.  “I want to make my parents, family, friends and school proud. My expectations are to play to the best of my ability and help my team to victory but more importantly to enjoy myself and gain experience at national level. “I’ve been passionate about rugby since a young age and I am glad that my hard work is paying off.  “It would really mean a lot for me to get a scholarship for high school,” he said. Devon has ambitions of representing the Springboks one day. “Making the WP XV team is a step in the right direction and I will continue to work my way up the ladder.  “My favourite player is former Springbok Bryan Habana as I liked his speed and humbleness.  “The excitement and joy of rugby is what I love about the sport,” he said. His father Clayton said: “Since Devon came into this world, we knew that he would make us proud and become a rugby player. From the age of two years he said: ‘mommy and daddy I’m going to be a Springbok player one day’ and every week we had to buy a rugby ball. “Devon has always been energetic, positive, goal-orientated, hard working and always striving to do his best,” he said.
