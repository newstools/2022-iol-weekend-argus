Joshua Muller is deft with a pool cue, has a sharp eye and he is only 9 years old.  He is preparing to compete in the national pool championships in Saldanha this year. Joshua, of Mitchells Plain, was selected for the competition taking place from July 2 to 6. The Grade 4 pupil, who attends Cornflower Primary, has only participated in the sport for a year and will be going up against players twice his age. Joshua, who plays for the Pool4Change club in Colorado Park, has high hopes. “I want to win, I go in with the plan to win, but you cannot win all the time,” he said. Joshua said he was over the moon when he heard he was chosen to play in the national competition. “When I’m older I want to play professionally, that is my goal,” added Joshua.  The disciplined boy not only performs well on the pool table, but also at school, explained his proud mom, Monique Muller. “He is a blessing. I never have issues with him, he is disciplined on and off the pool table. “He plays really well, I am not exaggerating. For example, he wins three out of his four games when they play rounds.  “He also shows the same discipline in his schoolwork, he was even top in his class for mathematics.” The 38-year-old recalls the first time Joshua held a pool cue in May last year. “He’s been showing potential since that first time. Even the older guys in our family were scared to play against him because he was so good. “At first we didn’t know that it would become this serious because children his age lose interest quickly, but since he took his first shot he stuck to his decision.” Muller added that it was particularly nerve-racking to watch her son play against older players. “But he is always so confident and I’m just so proud.” Muller thanked his coach, Rite Naidoo, for investing so much time in her son. The family has since started fund-raising to help cover for accommodation, food and transport to the event and back. Muller said the total cost of R1 670 has still not been achieved yet.
