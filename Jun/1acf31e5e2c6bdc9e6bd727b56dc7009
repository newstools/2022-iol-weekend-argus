Cape Town – The Cape Winelands District Municipality (CWDM) has confirmed that the fire on Lourensford Estate has been fully contained.  However, teams will continue to monitor the area to ensure  there are no further outbreaks. Spokesperson for CWDM, Jo-Anne Otto, said: “Although the rain has started and dampened the open ground, a lot more rain is required to ensure that all smouldering coals are extinguished.  “The CWDM’s Fire Services and ground crew teams will continue to do regular inspections of vulnerable areas such as the pine plantations and other areas with dense vegetation,” she said. The fire on Lourensford Estate started last week Wednesday, but flared up on Saturday, spreading to the Helderberg Nature Reserve. Otto said fire teams were able to stand down late on Sunday evening after good rains aided firefighting activities. Executive mayor of the Cape Winelands District Municipality, Elna von Schlicht, said: “The CWDM Fire Services applaud our partners for the excellent teamwork and their deep understanding of the complexities of wildfires and furthermore extend appreciation and thanks to all those that donated so generously during the fire,” she said.
