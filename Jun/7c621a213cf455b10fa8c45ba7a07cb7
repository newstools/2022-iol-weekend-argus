Cape Town – As the winter wind blows its way across the city, now is the perfect opportunity to practise your kite-flying skills and learn now to make one. The Liberty Promenade in Mitchells Plain will host a kite-making workshop from July 1 until July 10 and proceeds will go to Cape Mental Health. The cost is R10 per child and those who are interested can register at the ticket booth at the centre’s food district.  Participants also stand a chance to win one of 10 R250 gift cards by posting a photo of their decorated kite and tagging the mall on Facebook or Instagram with the #KiteArtPromenade. Marketing manager at Liberty Promenade, Najeeba Small-Ebrahim, said: “This year’s kite workshop aims to create awareness of children’s mental health and the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on their well-being.  “A recent study showed that South Africa has one of the lowest mental health scores in the world, and that mental health and wellbeing worsened during the recent pandemic. “Arts and crafts activities promote self-expression and are a fantastic creative outlet for kids.  “Flying a kite is also known to be therapeutic and can help to reduce levels of stress and spending time outdoors looking at the sky also helps to ease the mind and promote better mental health.  “We are thrilled that the workshop will contribute to Cape Mental Health, who do such vital work in various communities,” she said. Deputy executive officer at Cape Mental Health, Carol Bosch, said: “It is important for parents to ensure that children feel supported as they grow up.  “There are many ways in which we can support our children to ensure that they develop good mental health.” Weekend Argus
