KEAGAN MITCHELL Cape Town - A love for diversity in science and technology came in handy for Jaco Jacobs at an online international student science project competition. The Grade 11 pupil at Hoërskool Outeniqua recently received a gold award in the physics and engineering category at the recent Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl (GYSTB) Science Fair. He investigated automated inflation and pressure regulation for recreational and professional cyclists. Jaco said: “I feel very excited to have won this award and pleased about my hard work paying off. It was very interesting to be part of this competition. Not only was it a challenge to better my skills, but it also made me realise that there is a lot of potential out there for solving problems. I enjoyed the problem-solving and challenge of designing, building and coding the project. “I really love the diversity in science and technology. After matric, I would like to get my pilot licence and pursue a path in aerospace engineering or robotics,” he said. His mother, Esmari, said they are extremely proud of their son. “When he got chosen to take part in GYSTB 2022, we never thought that he would do this well. I mean, it’s a big event, with participants from all over the world. The best of the best. And to achieve this award, is truly amazing. I was in tears. We really look forward to seeing what path his future holds. But I know that he is meant to do big things,” she said. Eskom development foundation chief executive, Cecil Ramonotsi, said: “We remain committed to investing in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and innovation (STEMI), particularly for the young people of South Africa.  “The Eskom Expo for Young Scientists is one of the many vehicles under the Eskom Development Foundation that enables us to do this, and we are proud to have made a meaningful contribution to this programme,” he said.
