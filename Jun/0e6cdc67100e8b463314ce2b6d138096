Cape Town - A school teacher convicted of sexually assaulting a pupil five years ago has been sentenced to five years imprisonment and it has been ordered that his name be registered on the sex offenders list. This is known as the National Register for Sexual Offenders. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Eric Ntabazalila said Ayanda Ntuthu was given five years each for two counts of sexual assault but that the sentences would run concurrently. “The accused was convicted on two counts of sexual assault. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment for each count. The court ordered the sentences to run concurrently. He is effectively sentenced to five years imprisonment.  “The court ordered that his name to be entered into the register of sex offenders,” he said. Earlier this month, newly-appointed education MEC, David Maynier, said Ntuthu would face disciplinary action via a hearing and was suspended. Ntuthu had continued teaching at the same school where he was accused by one of the pupils and was eventually convicted on two counts of sexual assault in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. He had sexually assaulted a pupil at Thandokhulu High School in Mowbray in 2017. The charges against Ntuthu were provisionally withdrawn in May 2018 and placed back on the court roll and instated in September 2018. Weekend Argus
