Cape Town - A Bellville South family continues to live in hope after their mother, Anna Johanna Issacs, went missing in February.  Her birthday was last month and it was the first time her daughter, Maurison Elwina Issacs, had to spend it without her mother. Anna was said to have been seen walking away from her home that day. Maurison said she feels angry and sad that people are spreading rumours her mother has died.  “I just want the rumours to stop and for people to stop saying I don’t worry about her,” said her daughter. Dillan Torrens, a family friend, said: “I went there on the Thursday to go look for her. The lady that she lives with said that she had bags with her and was walking away from the house and nobody knows where she went. The guy that lives there told me he last saw her on Bellville bridge.” Torrens said they have been to several hospitals to look for her as she is a known psychiatric patient, but that it was the first time she had walked away from her home. On the Friday the family reported her missing. Last week two women came to the family and said they were sorry she was dead. The family was shocked and looking for answers. Yesterday, they had more people saying sorry she is dead, but the family have not heard anything indicating that she is dead. “We have no clue where she is or what she is doing. We are worried about her and miss her a lot. The only thing we want people to stop spreading false rumours that she is dead or in a hospital,” he said Issacs was last seen wearing a mustard top, black-and-yellow pants and a denim jacket. She has a scar on her left arm and black braids. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed a missing person was reported for further investigation.  “The investigating officer on the matter is going the extra mile, pursuing all available leads to ensure a breakthrough. The reported person is still missing and not yet reunited with her relatives,” he said. Weekend Argus
