A local NPO has stepped in to assist as many as 100 Mfuleni residents whose homes were gutted by a fire that killed one person on Sunday.  The fire broke out shortly after 5am at the Skukushuma informal settlement where one person died and 30 shacks were destroyed.  Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse said: “Several crews were on scene and the fire was contained and extinguished at 7:45 am. The body of an adult male was found amongst the debris.”  “More than 30 informal structures were destroyed leaving a number of residents displaced,” he said. Founder of Aurorah Kuils River CAN feeding scheme, Latifah Jacobs is now trying to help  around 100 residents who lost their homes and belongings.  One of the affected residents,  Nikita Sampson, 25, said they were awakened by the blaze which began at her neighbour’s shack.  “It affected us very bad because all of our stuff burned down. (The fire) started where the deceased was cooking and suddenly we saw the fire (spread),” she said.  Jacobs said her organisation began feeding affected residents on Sunday morning and providing blankets to those in need.  “I feed in the morning and afternoon at the nearby church. I have been sending food, clothing, and blankets since Sunday,” said Jacobs. However, Jacobs said they were running out of supplies to continue with the feeding scheme and the heavy rains were also affecting their efforts to assist.  “We usually assist the community until they are self-sustaining. At the moment we are in need of clothing and ingredients to make sure that these people are safe as there are heavy rains and floods that affected other houses as well,” she said. Local councillor ‎Nkosiphendule Lombi said conditions in the area had yet to improve and called on those with the means to lend a hand.
