THOSE affected by the blaze on Cape Town’s charming Helderberg mountain slopes received an outpouring of generosity from good samaritans.  The generosity was apparently so vast that nonprofit organisations, like the Volunteer Wildfire Service (VWS) and Working on Fire, were overwhelmed by physical donations.  Although cash is the preferred donation, tangible items like bottled water, bread, energy drinks and fruit were received.  The blaze erupted on the slopes of Lourensford on Wednesday but unexpectedly flared-up again on Saturday, as previously reported.  While no lives have been lost, the fire has destroyed dozens of homes, leaving many families without a roof over their head.  Places like the Somerset West Lodge accommodated many of those that had to evacuate their premises or that were left destitute.  Heldervue Spar also came to the fore, opening a collection point for refreshments. Firefighters who visit this Spar will also be able to buy drinks at a lower price.  Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis, who described the outpouring of donations as unbelievale, said the City will make a donation to VWS. “They did an exemplary job this week,” he told Weekend Argus, adding that he will “go and see them” on Monday.  ⚠️Fire Update⚠️📍#LourensfordFireEfforts to suppress the fire are ongoing as it continues to burn fuelled by the wind.

It will be closed for at least a month. Management warned residents that flying drones over protected parts of the reserve - especially in the vicinity of the fires was “illegal and extremely dangerous."
