CAPE Town - The trial-within-trial of a man accused of murdering his estranged girlfriend in order to claim insurance policies continues at the Western Cape High Court. According to court papers, Thulani Khumalo was in a relationship with his alleged victim, Ruwayda Solomons and had two minor children together. At the time of the incident, the children lived with Khumalo’s mother in KwaZulu-Natal. Solomons was allegedly invited by Khumalo to visit him in Cape Town in order for them to fetch their children. The State contends that Khumalo had allegedly planned this, knowing that the children were not in Cape Town. They are expected to prove that Khumalo had obtained two insurance policies in Solomons’ name with him being the beneficiary. On February 7, 2019, the duo met in Cape Town and while sitting in a vehicle they were approached by armed robbers. Solomons was shot several times and Khumalo escaped unharmed. The State contends that Khumalo had planned the murder to look like a robbery and hijacking. According to the court papers, Khumalo had asked them (robbers) to take his Toyota Fortuner and to kill Solomons. The vehicle was found abandoned a day later and Khumalo allegedly told police that the robbers had taken his vehicle and cellphone and murdered Solomons. Khumalo is facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder, murder, attempting to defeat or obstruct the administration of justice. Post-mortem results indicated that Solomons had died as a result of gunshot wounds to the back and head. Eric Ntabazalila of The National Prosecuting Authority said Khumalo’s trial-within-a trial was expected to continue at the Cape High Court today. Weekend Argus
