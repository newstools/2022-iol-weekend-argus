ACCLAIMED creative director Bielle Bellingham was responsible for curating the speaker line-up for Decorex 2022 Summit to be held in  Cape Town and Johannesburg. Decorex Africa is hosting a design summit to reignite architecture and interior design conversations in a post-pandemic world. Bellingham said she was motivated by the potency of art and design, as catalysts for change. “With a background in art history, publishing, interiors and experience design, I use patterns to reimagine the future,” she said.  The new Decorex 2022 Summit will be held in Cape Town from June 16 to 19. Next month, it will be hosted in Sandton from July 28 to 31. The summit will host talks and presentations about shifting insights from industry professionals.

The summit attendees will also get to earn continuous professional development  (CPD) points.   Attendees can expect to hear from speakers like interior architect and design educator Juliet Kavishe, architectural partners behind the Wits Art Museum, Nina Cohen and Fiona Garson, and many more.
