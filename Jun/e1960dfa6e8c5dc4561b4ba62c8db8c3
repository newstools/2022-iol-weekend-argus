The ANC in the Western Cape is calling for a snap debate to take place on Thursday’s sitting of the Provincial Legislature. The debate will focus on apparent DA infighting, specifically the friction between the speaker Masizole Mnqasela, suspended from DA activities,  and his deputy, Beverley Schäfer.  “As the leader of the opposition, I hereby formally request a debate on a matter of public importance at the sitting on June 9, under Rule 144 - Debate of Urgent Public Importance within the Provincial Parliament Standing Rules,” said the ANC’s Cameron Dugmore in his letter to the speaker’s office.  “The matter of public importance concerns the implications of, and the state of dysfunction within the Western Cape Legislature as a result of the internal Democratic Alliance divisions currently being witnessed, and the impact these divisions and dysfunctionality within the Western Cape Legislature are having on the service delivery in the province. “It is my view and in the interest of the public that this matter be debated and the legislature itself expresses its opinion on these matters.” Dugmore and the rest of ANC’s provincial caucus addressed the media on Thursday.  It’s no secret that Mnqasela - who is being investigated by the Hawks for allegations relating to subsistence, travel and entertainment allowance claims - and Schäfer don’t see eye-to-eye.  The pair were recently the subject of investigations by the legislature’s conduct committee. Mnqasela was found guilty for failing to declare his interest in a family trust. He will be reprimanded in the house today.  An independent investigation found Schäfer’s refusal to return a state vehicle resulted in fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R158 297.86.
