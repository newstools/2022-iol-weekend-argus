Cape Town - Eversdal Primary School’s Under-12A netball team hopped, jumped and scored their way to glory at the recent Western Cape Netball Top Schools Competition.  They walked away unbeaten in the Batho section, recording wins over Eikestad, Durbanville, Gene Louw and Vredendal primary schools. They will now compete at the National Top Schools Competition in Boksburg in August. Head coach Ria Coetzee said her side showed excellent sportsmanship and a great fighting spirit. “We played against the cream of the crop and never backed down from the challenges. We know the National Top Schools Competition will be tough, however, being able to go is a great privilege. We are also fortunate to have won all our league matches thus far. “(Moving forward), we will need to work on more than just basic skills and show a willingness to implement new skills learned. The team has a great passion and love for the game,” Coetzee said. Captain Marli van der Westhuizen described her team as hard working, creative, energetic and passionate. “We know each other so well. Not only are we teammates but also friends. Our coaches are always there to guide us and make us the best team. “We are competitive on court and always want to do our best. We are each other’s biggest fans and will always cheer for each other. Off court and between games we relax and laugh a lot. “We are very honoured to represent our school at the National Top Schools Competition and hopefully our hard work will pay off,” she said.
