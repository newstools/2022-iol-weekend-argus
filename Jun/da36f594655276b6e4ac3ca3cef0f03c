Kuilsriver police have detained two men for questioning in connection with the double murder of two foreign businessmen at their cellphone repair shop on Tuesday.  Police spokesperson, Sergeant Wesley Twigg said the incident occurred along the Van Riebeeck Road. “According to reports two unknown suspects entered the shop and shot the two victims. The victims were declared deceased on the scene by medical personnel,” said Twigg. He said police arrested two suspects and detectives  questioned them for a possible connection to the murder. A community activist, Latifah Jacobs said the majority of shopkeepers in the area were foreign nationals who are spooked by an increase in crimes targeting them.  “There are many foreign-owned businesses in the area. A Chinese shop owner was kidnapped a few months ago and the family had to pay ransom. These robberies and kidnappings of foreigners make people scared to open up businesses,” said Jacobs. While the motive for their killings is unclear, communities around Cape Town have seen an increase in attacks targeting foreign-owned business owners for extortion.  Earlier this month two Somalis were murdered at their shop in Nomzamo, Strand after armed suspects stormed their business and shot four people, killing two.  Two weeks before that, two Somali shopkeepers from Langa were killed.
