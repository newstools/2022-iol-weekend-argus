In an attempt to make inroads in Limpopo, an ANC-led province with strong EFF presence ahead of the 2024 national elections, ActionSA is geared to appoint former ANC leader Sello Lediga as its provincial chairperson.  Two sources with inside knowledge confirmed this to Weekend Argus.  Lediga is a former member of the ANC’s Limpopo provincial task team, political analyst and CEO of the Patriotic Movement, a civil society organisation that promotes patriotism in South Africa. ActionSA leader, Herman Mashaba, is set to make this announcement on Monday in Limpopo.  Mashaba refused to confirm or deny Lediga’s appointment but alluded to the new appointment. “I can, however, confirm that it is a former ANC bigwig,” he said.  “He resigned from the ANC on (his) own accord, but that was some years ago. “A friend introduced me to him and we’ve had several meetings including doing security checks and clearances to satisfy myself, cause’ it’s always difficult to get someone from the ANC, I think it’s a challenge to really get good people from the ANC,” Mashaba said.  Since the beginning of the year the party has launched between five to 10 branches in Limpopo every weekend, according to Mashaba.  “We have more branches in Limpopo than everywhere else in the country - it’s unprecedented, something I never expected to happen,” he said.  Lediga joins a growing list of politicians who joined ActionSA this year. Bongani Baloyi, former DA Midvaal mayor became the party's Gauteng's provincial chairperson in January followed by former Gqeberha DA mayor Athol Trollip a month later and Gauteng MPL Michael Shackleton in April. Lediga couldn’t be reached for comment.
