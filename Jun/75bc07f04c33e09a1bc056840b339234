Cape Town - A 29-year-old undocumented Lesotho national has been arrested three days after Tulbagh police initiated a 72-hour activation plan to investigate a shooting which left four men killed and a fifth one injured. The bodies of the four victims, aged between 28 and 35, were discovered at a residence in Jooste Street on Saturday night at about 9pm. The fifth victim, also a man, was admitted to hospital for treatment. Police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said the investigation into the matter led to the arrest of a suspect yesterday. “Detectives attached to the Western Cape Serious and Violent Crime Investigation Unit pursued all avenues and conducted their search for a known drug dealer in the local Marikana informal settlement which resulted in the arrest of a 29-year-old undocumented Lesotho national. “The suspect is scheduled to make his court appearance in Tulbagh (on Thursday) where he will face four murder charges and one attempted murder charge,” he said. Traut added that more arrests have not been ruled out. A reward of R100 000 has been offered for leads that will result in the arrest of the perpetrators.
