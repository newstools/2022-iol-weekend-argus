Emergency services workers had a busy morning in Paarl in separate  incidents involving two teens in a hit and run, and  a school bus with pupils veering off the road occurred on Tuesday. Russel Meiring, spokesperson for ER24 emergency medical service, said the team responded to an incident where two girls were hit by a light motor vehicle on Klein Drakenstein Road in Paarl. “On scene medics found a 14-year-old girl lying on the side of the road. (They) assessed her and found that she had sustained a serious injury to her arm. “Whilst treating the patient, a 13-year-old girl that had also been struck came forward. Fortunately, the girl sustained only minor injuries,” said Meiring. Both girls were transported to Paarl Provincial Hospital for further treatment. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Wesley Twigg said no case was opened but an accident report was filed. EMS workers also responded to a scene along on Sonstraal Road, near Ashante Estate in Paarl shortly after 7.30am where a bus carrying 51 pupils was involved.  Spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department (WCED), Bronagh Hammond said counselling support would be arranged for the affected learners. COSAS provincial Secretary, Mphumzi Giwu appealed with the drivers to be vigilant as the roads were still wet. “We wish (the victims) a speedy recovery and call on all motorists to drive with caution on the roads as we are experiencing severe storms,” said Giwu.
