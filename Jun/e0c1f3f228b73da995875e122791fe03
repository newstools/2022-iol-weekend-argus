Cape Town - The Animal Welfare Society of South Africa (AWS SA) has confirmed the full recovery of a kitten that was recently “tattooed” on parts of its face with a henna-type mix. Randal was admitted on May 25 to their hospital with partial paralysis and was discharged on June 4. The owner, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said they are relieved to have Randal back at home. “The energy in our home is restored. We have two smaller kittens whose moods have been down, but as soon as Randal came home they started playing again. “He is my little boy and helps me with my anxiety. I was not very close to animals before, but my heart has grown since having him in our lives and it has made me so aware of every living thing. “I would like to extend my love and appreciation to the Animal Welfare Society of South Africa and everyone who has taken an interest in his story. He is loved and he has a family who would do anything to see him healthy and safe,” the owner said. Spokesperson for AWS SA Allan Perrins said: “After a tense few weeks Randal started responding to treatment and it was decided to discharge him back to the care of his owners on supportive therapy.  “Since then Randal has progressed in leaps and bounds to the point where he is able to run around and relieve himself unaided.  “When I informed the hospital team entrusted with his care of this good news they were ecstatic and all look forward to his follow-up visit on Friday. “Cats are said to have nine lives and Randal definitely owes one of his  lives to the exceptional nursing team responsible for his diagnosis and treatment. His care bill totalled to about R7 000, but having saved his life is more important,” he said. Weekend Argus
