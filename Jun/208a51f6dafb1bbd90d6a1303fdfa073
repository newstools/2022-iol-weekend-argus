Provincial secretary of the Independent Civic Organisation of South Africa (Icosa), Eugene Ludicks, has resigned with immediate effect, Weekend Argus can reveal.  “It is with a heavy heart that I submit my resignation,” Ludicks said in his resignation letter which was submitted on Friday last week.  “The last (five) years at Icosa was a wonderful experience and I have been blessed to have been a part of this organisation,” he said. “However, due to personal reasons, I herewith resign as the provincial secretary and member of Icosa with immediate effect.” Ludicks, who couldn’t be reached for comment, was previously part of the ANC. He served as the party’s branch secretary in Kannaland.  Weekend Argus previously reported that Kannaland speaker, Roger Albertus, was mandated to initiate a disciplinary process against three Icosa members, whose outcome will be communicated to the MEC for Local Government, Anton Bredell, for a final decision. The trio include party leader and convicted child rapist Jeffrey Donson, and fellow councillors Werner Meshoa and Hyrin Ruiters.  Donson is the former mayor of Kannaland and was ousted in January in a motion of no confidence. The motion was tabled after Donson and his deputy, Meshoa, refused to step down after it emerged they had criminal convictions. Donson was convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl in 2008, he went to the Western Cape High Court to appeal the matter and was given a suspended sentence. Last year Meshoa was convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice over travel claims dating back to 2018.
