Cape Town - A Bonteheuwel mother accused of selling naked photographs of her four-year-old daughter on the dark web briefly appeared in the Parow Regional Court on Tuesday. However, the case was postponed to March 29 for defence to consult. The woman, who may not be identified, is facing charges of manufacturing of child pornography, possession of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and financial gain from child pornography and rape. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie said the constant postponements were unacceptable. “This is completely unacceptable, and in fact, slightly embarrassing, taking into consideration that matter was investigated by the FBI and Homeland, and our justice system is not only failing the child in this regard but our entire fight against gender-based violence, including the abuse of our children. “It boggles the mind that after all this time, still no formal charges have been brought against the mother. This is a travesty of justice. It is sadly safe to assume that we have gone beyond the point of justice delayed and just denied. We are now left in the position that gender-based violence (GBV) would appear to have little or no consequences. “I am appealing to our courts for the sake of the child, community and all those affected by GBV to act and to place this mother on trial for the horrendous crime she was accused of. This lengthy detail is unfortunately not fair on her either. On a daily basis, our justice system is failing us. This is a fine example of it. It cannot be allowed to continue this way,” he added.
