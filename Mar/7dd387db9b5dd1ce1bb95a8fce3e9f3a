DURBAN – Tweeps have called out Multichoice and DStv about the “closure” of the Russia Today (RT) channel, a Russia state-affiliated media outlet, since Wednesday. The channel, on DStv’s 407 channel, was displaying an E38-32 error code. “This channel is closed. Press i or check the 8-day TV Guide to find out when it will open.” Multichoice and DStv were tagged, with viewers wanting to know what was happening with the channel. All this, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since last week. Tweeps said Multichoice’s decision was attacking media freedom. Some said it was unfair as they paid for their subscription, which they would now be cancelling it, while others said they did not watch the channel and it made no difference to them. A few said they stood with Russia during this time. On Wednesday night, DStv said on its Twitter page: “MultiChoice confirms that as of today, March 2, 2022, Russia Today (Channel 407) shall not be carried on the DStv platform until further notice. Sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU has led to the global distributor ceasing to provide the broadcast feed to all suppliers.” MultiChoice confirms that as of today, 2 March 2022, Russia Today (Channel 407) shall not be carried on the DStv platform until further notice. Sanctions imposed on Russia by the E.U has led to the global distributor ceasing to provide the broadcast feed to all suppliers. pic.twitter.com/eago966Iqw Here is how Tweeps reacted: The announcement by @MultiChoice that it won't show @RT_com on its platforms is regrettable.@SAEditorsForum will write to Multichoice to request full disclosure about the decision.We stand for media freedom & support RT's right to exist.There are two sides to every story. The banning of any media channel/platform - whether we agree with them or not - sets a dangerous precedent for media freedom.We need a multiplicity of voices & diversity in the media.Audiences deserve to hear all sides to the Russian/Ukraine conflict. Good news, we don't even watch that channel We demand RT back on air with immediate effect! South Africa 🇿🇦 is not in Europe nor in USA 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/vlz38yFLR0 What about our money?
